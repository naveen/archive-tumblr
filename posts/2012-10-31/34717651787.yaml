caption: !!python/str "<p>the last pay phone.</p>\n<p>all across downtown, all day\
  \ and night, i saw people waiting around in line to use the pay phones on various\
  \ street corners. i think somehow i\u2019d trained my mind to ignore them, because\
  \ before yesterday, i wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell you where the last pay\
  \ phone i saw was, let alone whether one worked. i seem to remember always keeping\
  \ around a quarter in a bag or a jacket somewhere in case of an emergency where\
  \ i found myself stranded and i had to call home. (it still takes 25\xA2 to make\
  \ a call, right?*)</p>\n<p>standing there on the corner last night, looking at this\
  \ girl on the phone, blinded by the high beams of the truck behind us, i couldn\u2019\
  t help but smile. here are two technologies supposedly on their way out (landlines\
  \ and fossil fuel), but when all the \u201Cnew\u201D stuff can\u2019t support us,\
  \ we\u2019re back to square one. what will happen in a future where both are truly\
  \ extinct, instead of just endangered?</p>\n<p>* and, omg, remember the pay phones\
  \ in \u2018the matrix\u2019?!</p>"
