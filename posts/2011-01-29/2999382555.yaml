  <blockquote>\n<p>Early color photographs (100 years ago!) of Russia.</p>\n<p>My\
  \ grandather had a few photos of his life in the pre-revolutionary Russian Pale\
  \ of Settlement, but they were black and white, which is of course how I picture\
  \ life then. Seeing this is sobering, it\u2019s a few neighborhoods over from how\
  \ he grew up, but not too far at all, and the idea that this is what the world looked\
  \ like to him is kind of amazing to consider.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/08/russia_in_color_a_century_ago.html\"\
