caption: !!python/str "<p>In Japanese mythology, the Namazu (\u9BF0) is a giant catfish\
  \ who causes earthquakes. He lives in the mud beneath the earth, and is guarded\
  \ by the god Kashima who restrains the catfish with a stone. When Kashima lets his\
  \ guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes. Following an earthquake\
  \ near Edo (modern day Tokyo) in 1855 (one of the Ansei Great Quakes), the Namazu\
  \ became worshiped as a yonaoshi daimyojin (god of world rectification). (via <a\
