  >bornthiswaybitch</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The back story of this photo was really\
  \ great. I believe it was on the Sartorialist years ago. (if anyone knows a link\
  \ to the story, let me know) before she released The Fame. She was in SoHo with\
  \ her mum, and a photographer asked to take her photo, and when he asked for her\
  \ name she said, \u201CLady GaGa, singer/songwriter, you\u2019ll be hearing of me\
  \ in the future\u201D or something along those lines. The photographer had to stop\
  \ himself from laughing. Look at her now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>this is not SoHo,\
  \ kids! i know exactly where this is: Meatpacking \u2013 14th Street looking towards\
  \ that gas station and the High Line and 10th Avenue. and that \u201Cphoto equipment\
  \ rental\u201D place/sign is still there. and those cobblestones? yeah, they still\
  \ run into the tar like that. come on, DOT! and i think that construction on the\
  \ left side of the picture is still going on!</p>\n<p>don\u2019t ask me how i recognized\
  \ all that. new york, i haz a crush on you. (you too, lady gaga)</p>"
