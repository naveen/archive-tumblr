  \ <a href=\"http://www.ragnarrelay.com/\">Ragnar Relay</a> team. What is Rangar?\
  \ It\u2019s a 24 hour 200 mile relay race. I\u2019m running with a group of friends\
  \ who did it last year. Don\u2019t ask me what an \u2018internal pigdog\u2019 is.\
  \ I could tell you, but you still wouldn\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t even get it.\_\
  </p>\n<p>Anyway, we run Friday afternoon. Wish us luck!\_</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>incredibly\
  \ excited for this race</p>\n<p>bonus personal add-on for this year compared to\
  \ my last: i\u2019ll be jetlagged and will have gotten very little sleep</p>\n<p>yes!</p>"
