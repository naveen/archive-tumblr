  >marsbot</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you ever see those old men outside of random\
  \ NYC stores with the old school polaroid cameras? The kind with the big flashes\
  \ and the picture takes 10 minutes to dry. I see them every now and again. Maybe\
  \ it\u2019s just one guy and I see him on various street corners, I don\u2019t know.\
  \ I\u2019ve always wanted my picture taken but I was always afraid to ask. Tonight\
  \ I was walking home from work and I saw the guy standing on a street corner not\
  \ too far from my office. \u201CHow much?\u201D I asked. \u201CHow much you got?\u201D\
  \ he responded. He took my picture. It\u2019s completely unglamorous and I hate\
  \ how I\u2019m standing and I wish I was smiling, but here it is with all it\u2019\
  s imperfections; with all of my imperfections. I\u2019m really glad I finally asked.</p>\n\
  <p>The photographer\u2019s name is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/01/03/nyregion/20100103polaroid_index.html\"\
  >Louis Mendes</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>love the photo as-is!</p>\n<p>i want to\
  \ do this now</p>"
