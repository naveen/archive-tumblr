  <blockquote>\n<p><em>Stephen Wiltshire. This young artist is grabbing a lot of attention\
  \ by the likes of CBS and other national news outlets. Stephen has been drawing\
  \ cities since being diagnosed with autism at a young age, saying it\u2019s his\
  \ way to express himself. What\u2019s unique about this artist though is that all\
  \ he needs is a 20 minute helicopter ride above New York and after 7 days, 12 pens,\
  \ and a lot of music on his ipod, he finishes the massive 18 ft accurate depiction\
  \ of the city all from memory. He\u2019s so accurate that when drawing Rome, he\
  \ drew the exact number of columns in the Pantheon. His work is being shown at Brooklyn\u2019\
  s Pratt Institute along with his permanent gallery in the Royal Opera Arcade, Pall\
  \ Mal.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\
