  \ is towards the end when attendees presented their hacks in front of the judges</p>\n\
  <p>i can\u2019t remember what happened exactly here \u2013 but it must have been\
  \ hilarious because everyone has a big smile on their face</p>\n<p>i especially\
  \ love david villa\u2019s look with his hands up on his head</p>\n<p>this pretty\
  \ much sums up what happened on saturday: lots of space (general assembly), lots\
  \ of people (hello, nyc!), lots of hacks, lots of laughs, lots of excitement</p>\n\
