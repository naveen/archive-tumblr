caption: !!python/str "<p>last night, as mari and i were biking back home across the\
  \ brooklyn bridge, we saw a manhattan bridge that was half lit, half dark. (the\
  \ williamsburg was like this as well.) it makes you wonder if this was part of some\
  \ decades-old agreement: \u201Cthis bridge is as much brooklyn as it is manhattan.\u201D\
  \ hence, the perfect 50/50 split of power.</p>\n<p>and then you think: wait, we\
  \ use this word \u201Cpower\u201D; what does it mean? we use it a lot to mean \u2018\
  electricity\u2019 nowadays, but 'power\u2019 in the old days, in the grander sense,\
  \ before the widespread use of electricity (and other luxuries) meant something\
  \ more: the haves versus have-nots.</p>\n<p>today, with this frankenstein of a city,\
  \ where downtown and the riversides are without basics, the word \u201Cpower\u201D\
  \ takes on a new meaning. the old-school 'haves versus have-nots\u2019 don\u2019\
  t mean anything in this post-storm world. nature (not coned) determines who rules.</p>"
