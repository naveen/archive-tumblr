caption: !!python/str "<p>We announced the round-the-world, round-the-clock hackathon\
  \ a couple of weeks ago, and dozens of groups on six continents (come on Antarctica!)\
  \ have already signed up. With one week to go before it kicks off, we wanted to\
  \ give a few more details:</p>\n<p>The official sites are filling up, but there\u2019\
  s still some space available. Sign up for New York, San Francisco, Paris, or Tokyo.</p>\n\
  <p>We\u2019ve lined up an amazing roster of presentations and tons of speakers for\
  \ those in attendance. Foursquare developers will also be on hand and online to\
  \ answer all your questions!</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve updated the prize list (with even\
  \ more to come). There\u2019s some really exciting stuff, but nothing more striking\
  \ than the new hackathon title belt.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>"
