  <p>\u2019<em>I saw them before they were cool</em>\u2019 is a good way to look at\
  \ the adoption of technology.</p>\n<p><span>It reminds me of William Gibson\u2019\
  s quote \u201CThe future is already here \u2014 it\u2019s just not very evenly distributed.\u201D\
  </span></p>\n<p><span>What the rich are doing now or have access to now, everyone\
  \ will be doing and have access to in future. This is how luxuries like cars and\
  \ televisions found their way from a select few to everyone else.</span></p>\n<p><span>What\
  \ the geeks are doing with their nights and weekends now, everyone will be doing\
  \ and have access to in future. This speaks to the adoption of personal computers,\
  \ starting with the Homebrew Computer Club right up to the thing you\u2019re using\
  \ to read this.</span></p>\n<p>What the professionals are doing now (with their\
  \ coaches, professional tools and access to their own big data), everyone will be\
  \ doing and have access to in future. This is how I look at quantified self too\
  \ \u2013 the data is there, but we just don\u2019t yet personally have good ways\
  \ to interpret and make use of the data like the pros. See: \u201C<a href=\"http://grantland.com/features/expected-value-possession-nba-analytics/\"\
  >Moneyball for the NBA</a>\u201D and <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/procycling-talks-to-greg-lemond-13858/\"\
  >Greg LeMond speak about his experience in personal tracking</a>, both professionally\
  \ and after retirement.</p>\n<p><span>When you use something, you\u2019re using\
  \ for higher level of convenience (the wealthy to everyone else). Or you are using\
  \ it for a higher level of productivity (programming/computers in the hands of few\
  \ first and then to everyone else). Or you are using for a higher level of performance\
  \ (professional athletes to everyone else). If it doesn\u2019t meet these early\
  \ goals, then chances are perhaps good it won\u2019t break out of that early subset\
  \ into the mainstream.</span></p>"
