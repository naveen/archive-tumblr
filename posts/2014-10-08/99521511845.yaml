  \ last post on Snapchat, I\u2019ve actually been using it even more than ever. It\
  \ also definitely feels like more of my friends are back on it too. Perhaps it was\
  \ due to my post and our conversations that they\u2019re back on and equally curious.\
  \ Or perhaps it\u2019s because I pay more attention to Stories now and therefore\
  \ see more of them from others.</span></p>\n<p><span>I was talking to a friend about\
  \ capturing moments, either to share with friends or to share via Stories and I\
  \ realized one more interesting thing about Snapchat:</span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019\
  s that Snapchat is more like actual human conversation than anything else. Messages\
  \ are posted and then they go away, much like you talking to a friend in real life.\
  \ You say something in the moment, it gets heard and then it disappears - the only\
  \ residue is what\u2019s in your friend\u2019s memory.</span></p>\n<p><span>Indeed,\
  \ I have been using Snapchat so much now to capture so many moments throughout the\
  \ day into Stories that I wish the iOS lockscreen would allow me to swap in a different\
  \ app as the default camera swipe action.</span></p>"
