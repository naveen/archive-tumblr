  >brycedotvc</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife doesn\u2019t \u201Cget\u201D Foursquare.\
  \ In fact, she so doesn\u2019t get it that she won\u2019t even let me load it on\
  \ her phone. The idea of checking in and knowing where her friends are holds no\
  \ appeal. Despite my most compelling pitches for why she should be on there, she\
  \ hasn\u2019t budged.</p>\n<p>That is, until I showed her the Gap ad above. The\
  \ \u201CAdd to Foursquare\u201D button was something she saw immediate utility in.\
  \ If she reads a review of a restaurant she wants to try on a blog she follows-\
  \ Add to Foursquare. If she sees an offer for a store she wants to visit or a product\
  \ she wants to try- Add to Foursquare. Blending her online habits of discovery with\
  \ an app that reminds her of \_of these fleeting interests in the context of real\
  \ world activites made for a much more compelling use case than any I\u2019d ever\
  \ offered up</p>\n<p>Which is why I think \u201CAdd to Foursquare\u201D is important.\
  \ Its a way to fuse online intent with offline action that is compelling on both\
  \ sides of the click.</p>\n<p>To the merchant, its a compelling, \_lightweight way\
  \ of encouraging an action related to their product, service or offer in the moment\
  \ of authentic discovery and interest. It can be embedded in a company site, a blog\
  \ post or a banner ad. I\u2019ve not seen much real innovation in online display\
  \ ads over the years, but the marrying a banner ad with an \u201CAdd to Foursquare\u201D\
  \ button creates an\_entirely\_new ad unit that I think will be\_effective\_for\
  \ any advertiser with an offline presence- large and small.</p>\n<p>To the end user,\
  \ it provides real world utility. \_There\u2019s no flashing \u201Cbuy now\u201D\
  \ button or clicking of an ad that takes you out of your workflow. Its more of a\
  \ bookmark for the real world.\_Take a look at this <a href=\"http://nymag.com/restaurants/wheretoeat/2011/70277/\"\
  >list</a> of must try restaurants for 2011 from New York Magazine. With a few clicks\
  \ I\u2019ve now loaded up 4 I want to try on my next trip to NYC. No bookmarking\
  \ the article, no emailing myself the link. Now they\u2019re loaded up and actionable.\_\
  </p>\n<p>This is still a very new feature for Foursquare with light distribution\
  \ at the moment. But, as a user of the service, I\u2019m anxious to see more and\
  \ more of the \u201CAdd to Foursquare\u201D buttons out in the wild. As an investor,\
  \ I\u2019m encouraged to see the team delivering on their promise to move beyond\
  \ the check-in and unlock more utility for a broader audience of mainstream consumers.\
  \ And, as someone deeply interested in the intersection of location and mobility\
  \ I\u2019m excited to see how this market continues to unfold in new and unexpected\
  \ ways.\_</p>\n<p>One last point. These are the kinds of innovations you get when\
  \ you lead from the front. Team Foursquare lives and breaths this stuff. Location\
  \ is in their DNA. They were exploring the potential of\_mobile long before it was\
  \ cool. \u201CAdd to Foursquare\u201D is just the latest instantiation of the future\
  \ they see for a mareket they are creating. This isn\u2019t a move for the sake\
  \ of parity, this isn\u2019t a little twist on someone else\u2019s feature, this\
  \ is category defining stuff and that\u2019s why its important too.</p>\n</blockquote>"
