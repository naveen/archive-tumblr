  \ Our agency partners took us out to a little, hidden restaurant in Shibuya, Tokyo.\
  \ They handled all the ordering which was lovely because once again I could not\
  \ read the menu. Lo and behold one of the appetizer dishes was\u2026fried chicken!\_\
  \ Now the fried chicken was lightly fried (maybe even healthy) so I\u2019ll skip\
  \ over it. The rest of the meal was amazing and I can even tell you the name and\
  \ location of the restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Shirube </strong>(<a href=\"http://foursquare.com/venue/3956341\"\

  ?) when i was in japan</p>\n<p>next time! (adding to my foursquare to-do list!)</p>"
