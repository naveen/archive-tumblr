  \ chief geologist for the Second Avenue subway construction. He spoke rapidly and\
  \ lovingly of the stone that forms the foundation of his native New York City.</p>\n\
  <p>The rock under Manhattan is unique. Called Manhattan schist, it was forged some\
  \ 470 million years ago during the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea.</p>\n\
  <p>Unlike the rock beneath nearby Queens and Brooklyn, which is much harder to bore\
  \ through, the rock in Manhattan is soft and easy to excavate. \u201CIt cuts like\
  \ butter,\u201D Chestman said.</p>\n</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/08/second-avenue-subway/?pid=25&amp;viewall=true\"\
