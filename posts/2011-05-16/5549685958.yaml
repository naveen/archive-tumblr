  <blockquote>\n<p>Incumbents are encumbered.</p>\n<p>Encumbered with the knowledge\
  \ of business as usual. Encumbered with sunk costs and supply chains. Encumbered\
  \ with employee who\u2019ve \u201Calways done it this way\u201D. Encumbered with\
  \ shareholders to appease and market share to protect.</p>\n<p>Incumbents\_say these\
  \ these\_encumbrances are competitive advantages. Barriers to entry.\_</p>\n<p>But\
  \ the entrants. The entrants are free to\_re-imagine, to reinvent, to think different.\
  \ To make risky bets on unproven ideas and partners. They have nothing to lose and\_\
  everything\_to gain.</p>\n<p>And as this <a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2011/05/13/ascent-of-the-entrants-a-tale-of-revenue-migration/\"\
  >chart</a>, and history, suggests the opportunity is in entrants. More so now than\
  \ ever before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>amazing to see that RIM has not only held\
  \ ground, but in fact, has gone up! (and samsung\u2019s going strong, as it does\
  \ with TVs and things vs Sony)</p>"
