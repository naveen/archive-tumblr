  </span><a href=\"http://www.aiweiwei.com/\">Ai Weiwei\u2019s</a><span> installation\
  \ \u201CSunflower Seeds\u201D presents us with an undifferentiated field of grey,\
  \ filling the space between the bridge and the end wall of\_Tate Modern\u2019s\_\
  Turbine Hall. It is almost disappointing\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span><span>But you\
  \ can trudge over all 100 million of them, walk or skip or dance on these seeds,\
  \ all of them Made in\_China. Or scoop up handfuls and let them run through your\
  \ fingers, in the knowledge that someone, an old lady or a small-town teenager in\
  \ Jingdezhen, has delicately picked up each one and anointed it with a small brush.\
  \ Every seed is painted by hand. The town that once made porcelain for the imperial\
  \ court has been saved from bankruptcy by making sunflower seeds. It is absurd.</span></span></p>\n\
  </blockquote>\n<p><span><span>Ai Weiwei is surely one of the great artists of our\
  \ day.\_</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>"
