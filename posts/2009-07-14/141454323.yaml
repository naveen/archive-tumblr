  >fuckitup</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>LIFE IS HARD. LIFE FEELS HARD AT EVERY GIVEN MOMENT.\
  \ LIFE ISN\u2019T THAT HARD: WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO LOVE US AND THAT\u2019S ALL THAT\
  \ MATTERS. EVEN IF THEY\u2019RE JUST OUR FRIENDS OR OUR ROOMMATES OR MEN AT BARS\
  \ THAT TALK TO US AND TRY TO MAKE US FEEL BETTER WHEN WE\u2019RE DRINKING TOO MUCH\
  \ AND DON\u2019T WANT TO TALK TO ANYONE. BUT EVERYTHING FEELS OVERWHELMINGLY HARD\
  \ TO ME. LIKE I\u2019LL NEVER BE LOVED. LIKE I\u2019LL NEVER BE HELD AND HAVE IT\
  \ MEAN SOMETHING. OR ANY TIME IT DOES, THERE IS A TIME LIMIT OR A DISTANCE OR A\
  \ FEELING OF DOUBT. BUT I AM LEARNING TO STOP DOUBTING AND TO STOP CARING ABOUT\
  \ TIME OR DISTANCE BECAUSE FUCK IT ALL. NOTHING LIKE THAT MATTERS. WHAT MATTERS\
  \ IS RIGHT NOW. WHO IS LOVING YOU RIGHT NOW. AND SOMETIMES THEY LEAVE BUT DON\u2019\
  T WANT TO. SOMETIMES THE WORLD PRESSES AGAINST YOU AND YOU END UP SAD AND LONELY.\
  \ SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIE. SOMETIMES PEOPLE TELL YOU ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER. LIFE\
  \ HAS NEVER BEEN EASY. LIFE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY. YOU DON\u2019T DESERVE ANYTHING\
  \ EASY. WORK FOR IT. NEVER STOP WORKING FOR THE LIFE YOU WANT.</blockquote>"
