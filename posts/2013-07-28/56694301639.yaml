caption: !!python/str "<p>torcello, an island on the northern end of the venetian\
  \ lagoon. it was once the economic center of the area, bigger than venice itself,\
  \ but before long, the lagoon around the island became a swamp and people moved\
  \ elsewhere. now, supposedly only 20 people live on the island.</p>\n<p>i found\
  \ the island while reading up about venice and the history of the lagoon. i read\
  \ that hemingway stayed here in 1948 while writing \u2018across the river and into\
  \ the trees\u2019. i like the idea of finding the out-of-the-way places to explore\
  \ and to live and to create. as i move around the world, crossing off the big places\
  \ on my list, i\u2019m making a new list of these out-of-the-ways \u2013 those are\
  \ ones that i hope to come back to, should we ever need a place away from the places.</p>\n\
