  \ reminded me.<br/><br/>i knew it was a moment that was pulling nearer, but i\u2019\
  ve never been good at remembering dates. it was a year ago that i announced i was\
  \ leaving foursquare, and what a year it has been indeed. my buddy rick took a look\
  \ back at <a href=\"http://rickwebb.tumblr.com/post/29487496282/one-year-ago-today\"\
  >his year away</a> from his company, barbarian, and i thought it was a nice way\
  \ to summarize so many days. that got me thinking about all the big things and all\
  \ the little things that had happened in the year since. so here goes, a collection\
  \ of some of the most memorable days gone by \u2013 my thirtieth year:<br/><br/>-\
  \ i got healthy. i was a mess when i left: easily fifteen pounds over my usual average.\
  \ the vents on my suit jackets were always open, and i definitely don\u2019t remember\
  \ getting them cut that way. when april 1st showed up, i set huge rules for myself\
  \ both in terms of workouts as well as my diet. in the month of april alone, i cut\
  \ back ten of those pounds, illegal squatters that they were. i kept a food log\
  \ and a workout log. i hit the gym early in the morning and then jumped on my bike\
  \ in the afternoons to meetings around town. i wore my Fuelband and my UP and my\
  \ Polar heart rate monitor and stepped on my Withings scale over and over until\
  \ the batteries went flat.<br/><br/>- i spent more time with my family, especially\
  \ after my sister got into med school in the summer.<br/><br/>- i traveled. and\
  \ i traveled again. and then once more just for good measure. i went to los angeles,\
  \ woodstock, austin, marfa, niagara falls and tulum. a few friends told me that\
  \ the best thing to do would be to leave the country \u2013 to give myself entirely\
  \ to the idea of \u201Cgoing away\u201D instead of small weekend trips. some even\
  \ threatened to drop me off at JFK some afternoon so i would do it without making\
  \ excuses to turn back. i finally left on a longer, <a href=\"http://naveen.tumblr.com/post/34374416774/home-or-there-and-back-again\"\
  >one-way journey</a>: switzerland; france; monaco; spain; morocco; gibraltar; portugal;\
  \ germany; greece; turkey; lebanon; jordan; israel; india. and when i came back\
  \ from that, it still didn\u2019t seem quite enough so mars and i went to santiago,\
  \ buenos aires, colonia and to <a href=\"http://naveen.tumblr.com/tagged/ushuaia\"\
  >the end of the world</a>.<br/><br/>- i went to disneyland. it was the first time\
  \ i\u2019d ever been in my life and i think we must have ridden space mountain three\
  \ times in the first hour.<br/><br/>- i went to the olympics. i saw mo farah win\
  \ and usain and yohan electrify the stadium in the 100 final.<br/><br/>- i went\
  \ to the beach. and i got a sunburn for the first time in my life. ouch. so that\u2019\
  s what that\u2019s like.<br/><br/>- i learned to drive stick shift. i learned to\
  \ skateboard. i learned to sail. i learned to snowboard. i picked up even more conversational\
  \ spanish. some of this came from being in spain and south america but i\u2019ve\
  \ recently taken to using duolingo as well.<br/><br/>- i helped a handful of startups\
  \ and made a few good investments in a couple of them. three of them are just about\
  \ to launch in the spring.<br/><br/>- i read a lot of books - once four in a week!\
  \ i finally got a kindle and i found i no longer add recommendations to my wishlist\
  \ \u2013 i simply buy them and have them on my kindle instead. when i traveled,\
  \ i tried to read books that were pertinent to the place i was in (or near). england\
  \ got <em>the art of travel</em>. paris, <em>a moveable feast</em>. tulum got <em>on\
  \ the road</em>. cote d'azur got <em>the count of monte cristo</em>. india, <em>the\
  \ great railway bazaar</em>.<br/><br/>- i kept a proper journal for the first time\
  \ in my life.<br/><br/>- i became a part-time photographer (but i\u2019d \u201C\
  probably have to keep my normal job\"). i learned that photography is as much about\
  \ art and experience as it is about the numbers. it became a great stress reliever\
  \ and a way to journal life and my travels. i think this will be a hobby i keep\
  \ with me as i go on to work on future projects.<br/><br/>- i made a list of my\
  \ \u201Crules for living\u201D which i try to review everyday and abide by. it\u2019\
  s still a work in progress and i hope to share them one day in a future post.<br/><br/>i\
  \ always kept saying \u201Cyear 30\u201D wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal and that\
  \ it\u2019s just like any other. it turned out to be so much more and i\u2019m grateful\
  \ for that. my year 10 was a marker in that it was my first full year living in\
  \ the U.S. my year 20 was a marker in that it was a close to college and found me\
  \ moving to new york city. and now, year 30 has become a bookend unto itself.<br/><br/>now,\
  \ back to work.<strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.3328077995683998\"><br/></strong></p>"
