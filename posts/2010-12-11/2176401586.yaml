  s games \u2014 including most notably the Checkered Game of Life \u2014 are almost\
  \ entirely luck. It\u2019s one of the first lessons. Chess comes later, and models\
  \ a world in which merit triumphs. People like that game.</p>\n<p>It is indeed\_\
  bad manners to complain about one\u2019s luck (or to boast of it.) But if you don\u2019\
