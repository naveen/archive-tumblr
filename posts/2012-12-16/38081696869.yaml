caption: !!python/str "<p>an old-fashioned <em>timehop</em>:</p>\n<p>digging through\
  \ old shoeboxes at my parents\u2019 home, i came across some old negatives from\
  \ the 80s. they document our time in india and our visit to singapore, among other\
  \ memories. the little one in the negatives is me, as my sister hadn\u2019t yet\
  \ been born. i wish i could say i remembered more of that time, but something about\
  \ being so far away from the home you grew up in and not seeing the familiars frequently\
  \ makes you forget faster.</p>"
