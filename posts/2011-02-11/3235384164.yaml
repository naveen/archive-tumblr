  /></p>\n<p>Our deteriorating health is simply a symptom of our economic priorities.\_\
  When a country objectifies wealth more than well-being, this is what you get. The\
  \ greatest predictor of health is wealth (and health knowledge to a lesser degree).\
  \ When there\u2019s not enough money to go around for fresh, whole food, you tend\
  \ to buy cheap, empty, processed calories and stress over whether or not your paycheck\
  \ will get you through the month for you and your kids. Obviously there\u2019s no\
  \ money to afford a place in a safe neighborhood that stocks good food and safe\
  \ activity.</p>\n<p>I wish things were simpler, and everything wasn\u2019t so interconnected.\
  \ But health and well-being are significantly tied to the economic policies in all\
  \ sectors, even gasoline taxes (something I\u2019m busy writing about at the very\
  \ moment).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/health/weight-of-the-world-bmi/\"\
