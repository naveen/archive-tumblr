  >marsbot</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>foursquare bots. \_</p>\n<p>Years ago I created\
  \ an illustration of myself as a child. I affectionately called her \u2018little\
  \ mars\u2019 and over the years I\u2019d put her in various situations to help illustrate\
  \ my life. When foursquare needed a default user icon for girls and boys, I jumped\
  \ at the chance to use Little Mars for this. I altered her appearance slightly and\
  \ created a boy version as well. Little Mars (aka marsbot) also shows up in various\
  \ other places of the site/app if you know where to look. I\u2019ve slowly been\
  \ creating characters for some of my foursquare co-workers in the style of Marsbot.\
  \ Can you guess who is who? (hint: the girl is actually supposed to be me)</p>\n\
  <p>PS these are a work in progress.</p>\n</blockquote>"
