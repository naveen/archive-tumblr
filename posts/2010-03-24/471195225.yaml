  \ Festival) uses social media for social good. All of the local events are organized\
  \ 100% by volunteers and 100% of all ticket sales and donations go direct to projects.\
  \ </span></span>Last year <span>on 12 February 2009, the first Twestival<span> Global\
  \ was held in 202 international cities to support </span><a href=\"http://twitter.com/twestival\"\
  >@charitywater</a>,<span> wh</span><span>o were doing incredible work to help the\
  \ almost 1 billion or 1 in 6 people in the world that don\u2019t have access to\
  \ clean and safe drinking water.\_ Over 1,000 volunteers and 10,000 donors fundraised\
  \ $250k+, which resulted in more than 55 wells in Uganda, Ethiopia and India having\
  \ a direct impact for over 17,000 people. I was unable to attend Twestival last\
  \ year because it sold out before I could get a ticket! <br/></span></span></p>\n\
  <p>This thursday I will be attending Twestival Global 2010 in NYC. People in hundreds\
  \ of cities around the world will come together offline to support <strong><a href=\"\
  http://www.concernworldwide.org/\">Concern Worldwide</a></strong> by hosting local\
  \ events organized through social media.<br/><span><br/> As one of the largest Twestivals\
  \ in the world, </span><span>NYC Twestival will </span><span>play host to thousands,\
  \ raising funds for and awareness of Concern\u2019s vitally important work around\
  \ the world.</span></p>\n<p>You can participate as well by <a href=\"http://twestival.com/\"\
