  <blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m sitting in my office in Manhattan right now, but I haven\u2019\
  t actually been outside in Manhattan today. My office building has an interior staircase\
  \ down to the train station, which is also connected to the Rockefeller Center concourse,\
  \ where I went to pick up my lunch.</p>\n<p>This got me thinking: is\u2026</p>\n\
  </blockquote>\n<p>great idea</p>\n<p>it reminds me of hong kong. it rains a _lot_\
  \ in HK. there are a lot of tall office buildings (much more so than in nyc). many\_\
  of the buildings have walkways in between them. so it\u2019s possible for you to\
  \ walk in between ten buildings and to go eat lunch in another office\u2019s cafeteria\
  \ a long way away</p>"
