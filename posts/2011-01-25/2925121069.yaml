  <blockquote>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>I start by reminding people that <em><strong>we\
  \ don\u2019t have to cover everything</strong></em> in the 20 short minutes we have\
  \ together. I make it clear that I\u2019m available for follow-up emails and Skype\
  \ on any of the points we cover in the Ohours session, and that today is about getting\
  \ to know one another and diving in on a few of the topics they really want to cover.</p>\n\
