  \ playing around with many quantified apps and health services and fitness devices\
  \ over the years, I\u2019ve come to realize a few things about what works for me\
  \ and what doesn\u2019t. So I wanted to write these up somewhere, perhaps to keep\
  \ in mind when designing other things in the space, but also to come back to and\
  \ see how these rules hold up in future.</p>\n<p><span>\u2022 Small groups work.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>Social, after a certain point, doesn\u2019t really work. If the full-size\
  \ of a social graph actually worked, your progress would grow according to how many\
  \ followers you have. And this isn\u2019t true at all. (If so, my Twitter-backed\
  \ six-pack would be SO good right now.)</span></p>\n<p><span>If anything, the \u201C\
  social\u201D that works is your very immediate real-world group. I think this is\
  \ perhaps limited to four people:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2022 your spouse\
  \ or significant other: because, after yourself, you have to look good for just\
  \ one other person.<br/>\u2022 your doctor: he essentially gives you homework and\
  \ goals to meet.<br/>\u2022 your trainer or nutritionist, should you have one.<br/>\u2022\
  \ your close friend(s) with whom you work out and go for runs and with whom you\
  \ compare notes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>\u2022 A currency for comparison works.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>On the topic of social, a currency for comparison works and is more engaging.\
  \ Activity points of some sort across all activities is the best here: Health Month\
  \ points. This way you can be good at running and that\u2019s your goal. And my\
  \ goal is sleep and I work towards that. (Nike Fuel also comes close: my tennis\
  \ is your running.) And then we can compare progress towards goals without comparing\
  \ who ran more miles. Because at the end of the day, it just comes down to whether\
  \ we were active or not.</span></p>\n<p><span>If we\u2019re talking some specific\
  \ activity a bike tracker (Strava), then the only currency that matters is miles\
  \ - the currency is fine being all distance-based for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span>But\
  \ if the service wants to play across activities, then a new currency for tracking\
  \ and comparison is needed.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u2022 Changing goals every once\
  \ in a while works.</span></p>\n<p><span>Goals aren\u2019t forever. Goals aren\u2019\
  t once a year on New Years. Goals are rolling. This is why I felt a really nice\
  \ connection with Health Month. Even if you never gave it much thought, I\u2019\
  d like to think your goals in life are naturally seasonal. In the winter, you think,\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m wearing jackets and heavy clothes anyway, so I\u2019m going to\
  \ eat comfort food to keep warm and no one is ever going to see me.\u201D In the\
  \ spring, this becomes, \u201CI\u2019ve got to eat a bit healthier and get back\
  \ into a routine.\u201D In the summer, well, \u201Cbeach body\u201D mentality takes\
  \ over.</span></p>\n<p><span>Health Month happens to make them monthly and asks\
  \ you to change them on a monthly basis. I love this. What I\u2019m thinking about\
  \ this month is not what I\u2019m thinking about a couple of months from now. HM\
  \ allowed me to \u201Croll over\u201D the goals I wished to and allowed me to pick\
  \ new ones depending on how the rest of my life was going at a particular point\
  \ in time.</span></p>\n<p><span>Contrast this approach with nearly every fitness\
  \ app out there: you set up a single goal or a series of rules on initial launch\
  \ and then you just go through the same motions for the rest of your life. That\
  \ just seems broken to me.</span></p>\n<p><span>What\u2019s worked for you? And\
  \ what are things everyone seems to be doing that don\u2019t actually work?</span></p>"
