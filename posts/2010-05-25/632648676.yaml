  >foursquare</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After the overwhelming popularity of the\
  \ first annual\_<a href=\"http://blog.foursquare.com/post/523695214/a-few-weeks-back-a-bunch-of-crazy-kids-down-in\"\
  >Foursquare Day</a> (4/16/2010), we realized there was demand for getting a bunch\
  \ of you all together in one place. And then we were asked to be a launch partner\
  \ for the new\_<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/everywhere/\">Meetup everywhere</a>,\
  \ which helps people who want to have foursquare meetups self-organize, anywhere\
  \ in the world!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s simple: go to the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/foursquare/\"\
  >foursquare Meetup everywhere</a> page, and let others in your area know you\u2019\
  re interested, and then start discussing where to have your meetup. We\u2019ve selected\
  \ June 16 (get it? 4 squared=16) as the first date for the meetups to happen all\
  \ over the globe, and from there you can figure out how often your group wants to\
  \ get together (twice a month? once a month?). You can meet other foursquare users,\
  \ and maybe even get a swarm badge!\_</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/foursquare/\"\
