  \ new year.</p>\n<p><span>That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always tried to start every\
  \ first day of the year, no matter where in the world I am.</span></p>\n<p><span>This\
  \ year, I am doing a little of the same here in Rio: go on a short run (96\xBAF\
  \ outside!), finish a book where I\u2019m nearly at the end, start a new one, do\
  \ some writing, do some work, and then, because I am in Brasil: listen to some good\
  \ music and take a walk to explore and learn more about a new neighborhood.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>It allows for a little reflection, a little resetting, and a little bit\
  \ of conscious forward-thinking about how you should spend the rest of the year.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>That\u2019s a little bit of everything good.</span></p>"
