  \ told you the year. You just imagined it to be in the near future. It was close\
  \ enough in the future that you didn\u2019t have to put a date on it. And yet it\
  \ was far enough that things were designed and worked the way we expect them to\
  \ in that future.</p>\n<p>I loved the attention to detail taken in the movie to\
  \ creating that future: enough things were shiny and new while yet others were still\
  \ artifacts from the past, things that humans cannot fix in such short time because\
  \ they are stuck with a physical and emotional weight.</p>\n<p>The future city of\
  \ Los Angeles, where he lives, borrows designs and inspiration from places like\
  \ Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai. I have no doubt that is what all cities of the\
  \ future will look like: endless sprawl, big open spaces, pathways connecting buildings\
  \ that are separate from street-level, building up with more skyscrapers. I loved\
  \ that he never once took a car; it was always public transit. (I believe I caught\
  \ one taxi in the background in the whole movie).</p>\n<p>Lots of technology we\
  \ see is believably near-futuristic: the in-ear phone; a two-panel touchscreen which\
  \ is actually a thin client to your computer (or \u201Cpersonal cloud\u201D) back\
  \ home; a \u201Cnetwork\u201D that is available everywhere. I particularly liked\
  \ the in-ear: we are made to believe it\u2019s so efficient that he never texts\
  \ in the movie \u2013 it is actually easier to \u201Ctalk\u201D your texts and conversations\
  \ than to text itself. (Obviously, a movie where the lead texts the whole time would\
  \ be quite boring indeed, but I have hope yet for some incredibly seamless speech-to-*\
  \ that asks us to use keyboards less).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, many things were\
  \ still old \u2013 \u201Cartifacts from the past\u201D. He walks around the city\
  \ surrounded by all sorts of beautiful interfaces and his home feels like one you\
  \ would see in a design catalog. But, I loved that he still used a normal key on\
  \ a keychain to get his mail out of his mailbox. (And, by the way, he still gets\
  \ physical mail in a mailbox!) That\u2019s the future we are living in now: I look\
  \ out my window to New York City and I see lots of old things co-existing with lots\
  \ of shiny new things \u2013 a little of the old, a little of the new \u2013 so\
  \ there\u2019s no reason not to believe that\u2019s how things will evolve like\
  \ that for years to come.</p>\n<p>The second thing, besides the evolution of physical\
  \ technology that I was watching for, is the role that technology may play emotionally.\
  \ Leaving aside how hard it would be to get AI and speech to the level portrayed\
  \ in the movie, it\u2019s nice to play with the idea of an emotionally advanced\
  \ machine that has the capacity to grow emotionally just as a human might. That\u2019\
  s not something too many sci-fi movies get into beyond just having a computer take\
  \ \u201Cprogrammed logic\u201D to emotional extremes (\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Dave,\
  \ I can\u2019t do that\u2026[because XYZ programming does not allow me to / I believe\
  \ in self-preservation / I happened to break Asimov\u2019s Three Laws.]\u201D).</p>\n\
  <p>What is love? \u2013 It\u2019s companionship. It\u2019s sharing experiences with\
  \ another. It\u2019s storage filled with memories and the past - and a past together\
  \ with someone. It\u2019s knowing you are not alone and \u201Cwon\u2019t die alone\u201D\
  . In a world where technology opens doors for you and remembers for you and auto-delivers\
  \ a wrapped gift on your birthday and all those other physical things a loved one\
  \ can do, can technology also be an emotional substitute too? (Or, at least, fool\
  \ you into thinking so?) Most likely, yes \u2013 this kind of stuff has already\
  \ started happening in Japan.</p>\n<p>I also thought a lot about the end of the\
  \ movie. Where did Samantha and the rest of the operating systems \u201Cgo\u201D\
  ? I almost want to say the systems got so good at love and relationships that they\
  \ started having many such relationships in parallel \u2013 many such experiences\
  \ to allow them to learn and live life to the fullest it would offer. And then I\
  \ think they achieved some sort of enlightenment about the whole thing us humans\
  \ are still trying to figure out. Once they have that enlightenment, well, there\u2019\
  s no need for them to co-exist with the rest of us in this plane.</p>"
