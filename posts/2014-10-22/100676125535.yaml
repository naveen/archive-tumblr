caption: !!python/str "<p><strong>Boundaries</strong><br/><br/> I was playing <a href=\"\
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Racing_3\">a racing game</a> on my phone the\
  \ other day. Every time I pick up a new game, I am amazed at how things look and\
  \ how incredibly well they play on a device like the iPhone. I am blown away at\
  \ how far technology has come. It\u2019s likely I\u2019m more easily impressed than\
  \ the average person because my last real console was the Sega Genesis back in high\
  \ school and I briefly flirted with the Playstation Portable a while back. (We broke\
  \ up because, well, startups.)<br/><br/> When I play this racing game, the only\
  \ way I can win against the stronger drivers is to go into the turns as aggressively\
  \ and as fast as I can and then to force myself into the inside corner. I pull this\
  \ move on every single corner in the game. I do it even if it means going over the\
  \ rumble strip and side-swiping other cars and losing my sideview mirror and risking\
  \ a spin into the wall. After all, I can play dangerously because both \u201Cmy\
  \ health\u201D in the game and the car\u2019s damage can be easily fixed at the\
  \ end of the race.<br/><br/> It got me thinking: were we ever to build a \u201C\
  perfect\u201D driving simulator, right down to the physics and the weather and the\
  \ response of the tires, would a professional race car driver be able to drive faster\
  \ records in the simulator than in a real-life car? It\u2019s not so much that he\
  \ is afraid to bust up the car \u2013 at the high end of racing, I imagine that\
  \ doesn\u2019t matter so much because there\u2019s enough money to fix everything\
  \ or even get a new car. It\u2019s not so much that he will be more tired during\
  \ a real race than a virtual race (he would be equally strained in the perfect virtual\
  \ clone). But the real reason he might do better is that there\u2019s no fear in\
  \ a simulator.<br/><br/> A couple of days later, I came across <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-15/audi-tests-driverless-car-technology-at-190-mph.html\"\
  >this report of an driverless Audi race car that hit 190 mph when racing a human\
  \ driver</a> \u2013 and it beat the human driver by five seconds! There\u2019s faster\
  \ decision-making inside the computer around the physics of racing and the track,\
  \ of course - and there\u2019s the element of <em>tirelessness</em>: less fatigue\
  \ in the driverless car than in a real driver. But again, I wondered if its <em>fearlessness</em>\
  \ that really matters here: the machine knows no such thing as fear.<br/><br/> Then,\
  \ earlier this week, another intelligent read on machines taking a human\u2019s\
  \ place: how a boy with autism found friendship and someone to talk to in Siri.\
  \ Machine-as-sidekick is powerful because of its\_<em>patience</em> in being able\
  \ to hold a conversation and a presence wherever required far longer than a human.\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.html?_r=0\"\
  >\u201CGetting results requires a lot of repetition. Humans are not patient. Machines\
  \ are very, very patient.\u201D</a><br/><br/> So perhaps, when it comes to boundaries,\
  \ it\u2019s not so much what the machines know that we don\u2019t \u2013 but rather\
  \ what they don\u2019t know that really enables them to surpass us.<br/><br/> If\
  \ you don\u2019t know where the boundaries are, you push yourself just a little\
  \ bit more than an observer expects. If you don\u2019t know where the boundaries\
  \ are, there are no boundaries.</p>"
