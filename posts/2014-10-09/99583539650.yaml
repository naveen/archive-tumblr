caption: !!python/str "<p><strong>Flight reading</strong></p>\n<p><span>A few weeks\
  \ ago, I wanted to share a few books on my summer reading list. Summer came and\
  \ went, and I think I hit about one book a month. That seems like an easy number\
  \ without being too much of a stretch on schedules. And it\u2019s not bad considering\
  \ that I probably read the equivalent of a book a week via other sources (magazines,\
  \ journals, &amp;c). The summer was actually less \u2018beach reading\u2019 for\
  \ me and more like short-haul flight reads. (I guess I\u2019ve seen pretty much\
  \ every movie in the in-flight.)</span></p>\n<p><span>Now that summer\u2019s over,\
  \ maybe it\u2019s time I made this the \u201C2014 reading list\u201D \u2013 I\u2019\
  ve got three months left (the last month could find me really pick up more speed\
  \ with all the holidays and free time).</span></p>\n<p><span>Books in progress and\
  \ still to come between now and the end of the year:</span></p>\n<p><span>\u2022\
