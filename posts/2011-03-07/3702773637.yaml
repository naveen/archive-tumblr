  <blockquote>\n<p>Anyone see \u201CThe Adjustment Bureau\u201D this weekend? If you\
  \ did, you noticed The New York Public Library\u2019s landmark Stephen A. Schwarzman\
  \ Building on 42nd Street prominently featured (it was basically the Bureau\u2019\
  s very beautiful headquarters). Here\u2019s a pic from our Special Events Department\
  \ of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt running through our Rose Main Reading Room, just\
  \ one of many scenes featuring the building, which is turning 100 in May. You can\
  \ see other images of the filming <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150137362863338&amp;set=a.284845893337.180661.284426003337&amp;theater#!/album.php?fbid=284845893337&amp;id=284426003337&amp;aid=180661\"\
  >here</a>. Also, the movie is based (albeit loosely) on a short story by Philip\
  \ K. Dick, the writer whose stories inspired blockbusters like \u201CBladerunner,\u201D\
  \ \u201CScanner Darkly\u201D and \u201CTotal Recall.\u201D Want to check out his\
  \ writing? We have plenty of <a href=\"http://catalog.nypl.org/search~S1?/Xphilip+dick&amp;searchscope=1&amp;SORT=D/Xphilip+dick&amp;searchscope=1&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=philip%20dick/1%2C305%2C305%2CB/browse\"\
