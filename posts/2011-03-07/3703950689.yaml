  \ 111-111-1111 \u2014 Ten Ones \u2014   my real-time edit of NYTimes.com visual\
  \ matter. At the urging of The  New  York Times legal department, I have suspended\
  \ postings and removed  the  archive. <br/><br/>I created this Tumblr in the summer\
  \ of 2010 as an  experiment to see  how the Times \u2014 where I worked as a web\
  \ editor \u2014  could use the platform.  (The name refers to the Caller ID signature\
  \ of  The New  York Times.) The blog was a personal project viewing the   NYTimes.com\
  \ feed through an aesthetic lens. I surfaced beautiful and   unexpected imagery,\
  \ credited it and linked to the source articles. <br/><br/>Fundamentally,  Ten Ones\
  \ was a daily accounting of the amazing  online report the paper  produces. It highlighted\
  \ in particular the  impressive work of Times  photographers, illustrators, photo\
  \ editors and  art directors.\_ <br/><br/>The  blog garnered a small audience on\
  \ Tumblr and a following in the   newsroom of The Times. When it came to the attention\
  \ of the company\u2019s   Senior Counsel, he asked that I remove all copyrighted\
  \ New York Times  content. This request effectively ended Ten Ones.<br/><br/> Thanks\
  \ to my  friends at The Times and elsewhere who encouraged this  project and  helped\
  \ get the word out. Thanks, too, to my Tumblr followers  and  rebloggers for answering\
  \ the call.<br/><br/>Jonathan S. Paul<br/> Editor<br/><a href=\"mailto:tenones.tumblr@gmail.com\"\
