caption: !!python/str "<p><strong>signals vs noises</strong></p>\n<p><span>i started\
  \ a new practice around this time last year: i wanted to rely less on my phone and\
  \ i wanted to cut back on distractions during the day. so i turned off almost all\
  \ notifications on my iPhone (and my computer).</span></p>\n<p>i did this in phases,\
  \ of course, as one can\u2019t go all-in.</p>\n<p>\u2022 to start, i turned off\
  \ notifications on less-frequently (or never) used applications. these were just\
  \ taking up room in the notifications drawer anyways. i rarely use such apps passively.\
  \ that is, i launch this kind of app to get information out and never find the need\
  \ to push me anything valuable.</p>\n<p>\u2022 i then made sure that all notifications,\
  \ no matter where they come from, never \u2018light\u2019 up the screen \u2013 they\
  \ only appear when i swipe into the notifications drawer. a good side-effect of\
  \ this is that it no doubt will increase your battery life. the screen doesn\u2019\
  t have to wake up a hundred times a day, as most of these will go unnoticed with\
  \ the phone in your pocket.</p>\n<p>\u2022 i also turned off all sounds for alerts:\
  \ the only thing that rings is a phone call. old-school. a negative of this is that\
  \ i sometimes miss a text message or two and don\u2019t answer them until some time\
  \ has passed. (if you really wanted to, you could set up Messages so that it\u2019\
  s silent in 'silent mode\u2019, but vibrates in 'normal mode\u2019: this way you\
  \ at least can keep up with texts when you\u2019re in a mode where you\u2019re expecting\
  \ someone.)</p>\n<p>i recently brought this idea to bed: instead of using an alarm\
  \ clock, i sometimes wake up with the Jawbone UP\u2019s alarm. it vibrates softly\
  \ on your wrist and nudges you out of bed; there are no noises. a bonus is that\
  \ there\u2019s no option to snooze with this method: there\u2019s no chance for\
  \ me to stagger my wake-up nine minutes at a time. the more i got used to vibrate-as-alarm,\
  \ the more i fell in love with this type of signal. if it vibrates during the day,\
  \ it means that i\u2019ve been idle and that i should move more. if it vibrates\
  \ early in the morning, it\u2019s time to wake up.</p>\n<p>i\u2019ve been looking\
  \ for more signals like it.</p>"
