  \ the same turkey dinner. what\u2019s fascinating though is in the way we each prepare\
  \ it: each dish made according to styles and habits handed down from generation\
  \ to generation, each place setting different from home to home. at my parents\u2019\
  \ house, as you might imagine, it\u2019s very much west-meets-east: holiday classics\
  \ with a slight indian twist. each meal at our home is incredible, but i particularly\
  \ like our version of america\u2019s holiday dinner. there\u2019s no other like\
  \ it.</p>\n<p>happy thanksgiving!</p>"
