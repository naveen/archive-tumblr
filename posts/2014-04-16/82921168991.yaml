  \ if we\u2019ve got it all wrong?</span></p>\n<p><span>What if we\u2019re not actually\
  \ supposed to wear all sorts of technology on our bodies and on our clothes? What\
  \ if we didn\u2019t have to / weren\u2019t meant to carry our technology with us\
  \ as we moved around town?</span></p>\n<p><span>What if the technology was actually\
  \ already in the room when we got there? Maybe that\u2019s the kind of Internet-of-things\
  \ that will be more sustainable and will win long-term.</span></p>\n<p><span>We\
  \ already have early indications that this is a product category that is succeeding\
  \ and sees more engagement long-term than the types we carry around. I can\u2019\
  t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve personally experienced or heard anecdotes\
  \ about the typical wearable drop-off: you stop using a device or service after\
  \ four to six weeks of breaking-in. On the other hand, the most successful types\
  \ of hardware I\u2019ve seen recently are Nest Thermostat and Withings Wi-Fi Scale,\
  \ both of which you plug in and use, perhaps not multiple times a day, but every\
  \ once in a while for many days and years to come.</span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019\
  s true that both tap into something that we were doing for years as opposed to having\
  \ us learn about and track something new. (The Nest tracks temperature; the Withings,\
  \ weight). But there are other smart devices that are around the corner that fit\
  \ my proposal too: a bed that tracks you and vibrates to wake you up gently; a smart\
  \ toilet or shower that tracks your body\u2019s physiology, diet and illnesses;\
  \ a smart kitchen that\u2026well, you get the picture.</span></p>\n<p><span>That\u2019\
  s not to say that wearables have no place in our future \u2013 perhaps the way they\
  \ should evolve is to become really cheap, incredibly dumb single-feature sensors\
  \ that actually need another layer like our phone or like a pairing with a there-able\
  \ device.</span></p>\n<p><span>Wearables know it\u2019s us because we exclusively\
  \ wear them and sync them with our phones. That\u2019s the authentication: our phones\
  \ and the identity handoff that resides in that exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span>There-ables\
  \ infer identity based on how you interact with them. There-ables know it\u2019\
  s us because, well, they are smarter: Nest knows our heat signature. Withings knows\
  \ our body composition.</span></p>\n<p><span>There-ables have fewer power restrictions;\
  \ they\u2019re often just plugged right into the power grid and, therefore, don\u2019\
  t need to have batteries charged everyday.</span></p>\n<p><span>Meanwhile, by being\
  \ battery powered, wearables can be smaller, cheaper and more abundant all over\
  \ your body. Perhaps wearables can become like the zippers in our clothing: cheap\
  \ enough and standardized enough to be in basically every piece of clothing we have\
  \ on. Or perhaps wearables will take the form of the \u201Csmart pill\u201D we keep\
  \ hearing about: you take it and the results are later calculated by your futuristic\
  \ toilet and zoomed to the cloud for review.</span></p>\n<p><span>Here\u2019s a\
  \ final thought in this argument: that we may not want to carry more than one device\
  \ with us when we move around. Currently, that is our phone. Yes, it\u2019s a whole\
  \ bunch of other things too (wallet, keys, \u2026) but, more than likely, these\
  \ things will all just continue to collapse into one thing: our phone.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>And then maybe, besides our phones, the best technology is one that\u2019\
  s already present where we are going.</span></p>"
