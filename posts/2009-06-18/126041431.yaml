  \ but they\u2019ve got a good foundation in place. \_They\u2019ve got a great opportunity\
  \ to beat Yelp in one regard - closer to real-time results on where people are going.\
  \ \_I think of it like Google vs. Twitter - Google\u2019s search is comprehensive\
  \ but takes awhile to crawl, so they\u2019re always a few days behind - but Twitter\
  \ can provide up-to-the-second updates on what people are saying. \_So if I\u2019\
  m looking for the restaurants in SF that are really gaining popularity, or a bar\
  \ that\u2019s going to have a lot of girls on Friday night (hypothetically, of course,\
  \ I\u2019m married now!), foursquare could, one day, tell me that.</p>\n</blockquote>"
