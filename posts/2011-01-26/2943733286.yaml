  \ inbox.  Know what else is fun? Shooting Daily Candy videos. The team is so  great,\_\
  \ shooting these videos for making tomato based soups was a breeze  \u2013 even\
  \ with a double ear infection!</p>\n<p>The videos turned out fantastic (thanks to\
  \ great editing) and the  final images of the finished dishes are gorgeous. Maybe\
  \ next time I can  get them to give me some photography lessons in between takes!</p>\n\
