  \ stuff that I\u2019ve done somewhere else. I kinda hated that I wasn\u2019t posting\
  \ anything \u201Coriginal\u201D on tumblr. So I\u2019ve gone ahead and deleted all\
  \ of those entries (it was sad to see thousands of pieces go\u2026). Instead of\
  \ posting random \u201Cfound\u201D things or reblogging here, I\u2019m going to\
  \ use this as my music blog. I\u2019m going to post one new song a day that either\
  \ makes me move, is really listenable, reflects mood or just because. [sic] These\
  \ posts might also sync up with the tracks I \u2018heart\u2019 over at <a href=\"\
