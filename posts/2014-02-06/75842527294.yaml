  <p>These past few months, I have been helping a couple of startups I like.</p>\n\
  <p>Sometimes, I have been investing in them. (Well, I\u2019m trying to: I am basically\
  \ making it up and learning as I go along, but it could be argued that\u2019s what\
  \ all angel investing really is about.)</p>\n<p><span>Sometimes, I have been spending\
  \ time hanging out at a company and helping more directly.</span></p>\n<p><span>But\
  \ regardless of whether I invest or help a team more directly, I think the way I\u2019\
  ve been thinking about it is to only get involved in projects that I wish I myself\
  \ had started. (Max Levchin said it best: \u201C<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mlevchin/status/408612954402062336\"\
  >One of the best heuristics I found when deciding to invest [in] a startup is whether\
  \ I would seriously consider joining it, if asked.</a>\u201D).</span></p>\n<p><span>The\
  \ company that I\u2019ve spent the most time with recently is <a href=\"https://www.hioscar.com/\"\
  >Oscar Health</a>: I\u2019ve been here for the last five months.</span></p>\n<p><span>If\
  \ you know me, you already know I\u2019ve been curious about and playing around\
  \ in the health space. My hacking around in the quantified self space brought me\
  \ to personal health, which is basically the idea of using tools (either built by\
  \ the community or by health &amp; fitness companies) to take charge of our own\
  \ health. This personal health movement can be thought of one model where care is\
  \ proactive rather than reactive. All this got me closer to learning about where\
  \ the healthcare system is really broken and needs technology\u2019s help the most.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>That, of course, brought me to Oscar. I had already known the guys before\
  \ they got started and I was always excited about the possibilities anytime we got\
  \ together to talk about the idea of starting an insurance company. If you want,\
  \ think of my exploration as a see-saw: \u201Cthings that we do for ourselves\u201D\
  \ on the left and \u201Cthings a care provider does for us\u201D on the right. I\
  \ started on the left and I slowly started learning and moving right. And then I\
  \ figured I should skip ahead and jump all the way to the right and see the world\
  \ from Oscar\u2019s perspective.</span></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019ve been helping Oscar\
  \ in various roles: with recruiting for different parts of the team (mainly on the\
  \ product and engineering sides); with general company \u201Cthings\u201D (helping\
  \ with PR/marketing, with process, organizing engineering and recruiting meets,\
  \ &amp;c.).</span></p>\n<p><span>I also spent a lot of time helping build different\
  \ parts of the product:</span></p>\n<p><span>The mobile experience - of course,\
  \ this one was easy. Many of our members are young and tech-savvy and almost always\
  \ on their mobile phones. They order food, their cabs, buy movie tickets, read the\
  \ news, see train times, search for things exclusively on mobile. So why shouldn\u2019\
  t they have a great experience where their healthcare questions and delivery also\
  \ happens on mobile? I made this a big priority for the team for the January 1st\
  \ launch: we worked nights and days with a very tiny team. And, in something like\
  \ eight weeks, we put together a great <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oscar-health/id781584599?mt=8\"\
  >Oscar Member app for iOS</a>. (Yes, Android at some point very soon!).</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>The care finder - this tool can be thought of as your first point of contact\
  \ when you look to solve an issue in health for yourself or a family member. Instead\
  \ of blindly Googling for an answer, we imagine that Oscar itself can be your first\
  \ point of contact. You could even think of it like <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/explore\"\
  >foursquare\u2019s \u201CExplore\u201D</a>: before you go somewhere, use the search\
  \ and allow it to pass you to the right spot. The mechanics of how this works are\
  \ hidden behind the scenes in order to keep the interface simple, but the idea is\
  \ that it will use basic information about each provider to point you to the right\
  \ place. Over time, we imagine this system can get better as more data points and\
  \ views from your friends are added in. \u201CShow me only doctors that can speak\
  \ Spanish.\u201D \u2013 \u201CGo here because many people your age go here.\u201D\
  \ \u2013 \u201CShow me only providers that have many years of experience and happen\
  \ to be tech-savvy, too.\u201D Why should a health insurance company only step in\
  \ at the very end of care? (That is: at the point where care has already been delivered\
  \ and the insurer only steps in to pay your bill for you.) The idea instead is that\
  \ when you need help, you ask us and we point you to an appropriate place of care\
  \ that not only solves your needs but also does it transparently.</span></p>\n<p><span>The\
  \ \u201CDoctor on Call\u201D - this one is something we are really proud of and\
  \ excited about. Some of us were lucky enough to grow up with a family doctor who\
  \ would be able to answer simple questions over the phone: helping you get care\
  \ and saving you time from having to drive out to the doctor\u2019s office and taking\
  \ a couple of hours out of your work day. Whatever happened to those days? Oscar\u2019\
  s \"Doctor on Call\u201D does exactly this. We\u2019ve partnered with Teladoc and\
  \ their physician network to provide this service. So, at any time, no matter where\
  \ you are (in the U.S.), you\u2019ll be able to ring up a doctor and talk to them\
  \ about a problem you have. The doctor will be able to recommend a solution, prescribe\
  \ you medicine or, in cases where a further in-person visit is needed, send you\
  \ to a specialist to get care. And the best part: all this is free for members.\
  \ We could have pointed members to independent applications out there now that seem\
  \ to do this, but we wanted to embed this experience natively into Oscar itself.\
  \ This way, you never have to leave this ecosystem and use yet another login to\
  \ use such a system. And by seamlessly integrating this, we could also hide the\
  \ costs and make it free for you in a much easier way.</span></p>\n<p><span>All-in-all,\
  \ this is just the start of even deeper products and issues Oscar can solve.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>The appeal in Oscar is not only that we get to see through 2014 eyes and\
  \ solve all the things that incumbents have trouble solving. Or the fact that we\
  \ can bring a tech-focused approach and solutions to the health care space. To me,\
  \ the most exciting is that by starting over from scratch, we have the ability to\
  \ write a new playbook on how a health insurance company should work. We have a\
  \ chance to provide additional features and services that customers have not expected\
  \ before. We have the ability to start your care and our relationship with you not\
  \ after you get hurt and after you\u2019ve been fixed up by the doctor, but rather\
  \ by being the first point of contact when you do need care. And perhaps, someday,\
  \ so easy we will even get one step ahead of you and actively alert you to offer\
  \ you services before you come to realize you need them.</span></p>"
