  >MICHAEL SHIRT by Wintercheck Factory</a></p>\n<p>In case my body doesnt sell these\
  \ shirts all on its own, I would like to inform you that the shirt is SUPER comfy.</p>\n\
  <blockquote>\n<p>Michael is our take on the men\u2019s Guayabera, sans the flowery\
  \ embroidery. The fabric for this garment was originally sourced for our Eunice\
  \ Dress but we were so impressed by it\u2019s softness (it\u2019s made with Tencel)\
  \ that we had to incorporate it into the men\u2019s line as well. Straying from\
  \ the traditional Guayabera cut, Michael is slightly more fitted to the body but\
  \ retains the classic short sleeve design with four buttoned pockets.</p>\n<p>Sizing\
  \ &amp; Fit: Michael is made to fit comfortably but is still true to size. If you\
  \ must, we recommend that you size down rather than up for a closer fit. Our model\
  \ wears a size Medium. See our spec sheet for additional details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
  <p>It\u2019s a good thing nobody really calls me Michael otherwise this shirt would\
  \ be weird.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wintercheckfactory.com/shop/19-michael-shirt\"\
  >BUY</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, this shirt is named after @msg.</p>\n<p>No,\
  \ it does not come with a hat.</p>\n<p>(related: back in the day my friend Danners\
  \ was reconstructing old jeans as a side gig and she was offering up the \u201C\
  DPSTYLES\u201D pants treatment)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>hole in the crotch?</p>"
