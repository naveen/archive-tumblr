  t been able to post much lately, but my friend Rony posted some of my New Years\
  \ Eve photos on his site, <a href=\"http://ronyspb.com/12-31-10/all.html\">go check\
  \ them out</a>! For the few people who are interested in this look, it isn\u2019\
  t a photoshop filter, iPhone app, or special effect - this is how the photo looked\
  \ in camera, it\u2019s just slow shutter sync with motion blur.</p>\n<p>I\u2019\
  ve been considering a solution to share the hundreds/thousands of pictures I shoot\
  \ every week without making a party photo website, but until then\u2026</p>\n</blockquote>"
