  \ love timehop, like everyone else who loves it, because it surfaces moments from\
  \ years past. And every once in a while, a moment touches a nostalgic feeling or\
  \ a perfect outing or brings back a favorite memory \u2013 one of those memories\
  \ so rare in life.</p>\n<p>Over time, I have noticed a couple of things especially\
  \ fascinating about timehop \u2013 and, by extension, my own past.</p>\n<p>First,\
  \ I have noticed that over the years, the way I\u2019ve been posting online has\
  \ changed. Gone are the careless tweets and the random late night postings into\
  \ 5am. I wonder if that\u2019s because I\u2019ve just gotten older and more mature\
  \ - or, if that\u2019s because of some version of the Hawthorne effect: that is,\
  \ by observing my behavior in years past and knowing through timehop I will revisit\
  \ them, that perhaps I\u2019ve just gotten smarter and more filtered about the kinds\
  \ of things I post there. By observing, I\u2019ve changed my habits: both because\
  \ I\u2019ll have to see it again in future, but also because observing my own things\
  \ from years past constantly reminds me that ever more people are looking at my\
  \ posts from years past. The more I post, perhaps the less I am posting for myself,\
  \ and rather more for others.</p>\n<p>Second, time and again, it\u2019s showed me\
  \ how we are more creatures of habit than we sometimes like to think.</p>\n<p>We\
  \ were at dinner Wednesday night and I realized I hadn\u2019t checked my day\u2019\
  s timehop. When we opened it, timehop reminded us that on that day last year, January\
  \ 29th, 2013, we were in sunny Los Angeles. We looked out the window to a cold,\
  \ cold New York and continued scrolling through.</p>\n<p>We scrolled to last year\u2019\
  s dinner: Osteria Mozza in LA. We had grilled octopus as an appetizer. (Not something\
  \ we do very often; let\u2019s say perhaps a couple of times a year).</p>\n<p>When\
  \ we saw that post, we were amazed: we were looking at that post at dinner in NYC\
  \ \u2013 and the starter we had just ordered got to our table: grilled octopus as\
  \ an appetizer.</p>\n<p>What are the chances that something like that could happen?\
  \ And that it could happen, not on any random day in the past, but on the same day\
  \ a year ago.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s happened. In the\
  \ past, I\u2019ve noticed how:</p>\n<p>\u2022 I\u2019ve run races (sometimes, the\
  \ same race, sometimes not) on the same weekend two or three years in a row.<br/>\u2022\
  \ I\u2019ve gone to visit my sister or my family in the same weekend back-to-back\
  \ (not just holiday weekends here, but random ones peppered throughout the year).<br/>\u2022\
  \ A day spent wandering stores in SoHo repeats itself.\_</p>\n<p>You think you know\
  \ your past \u2013 you lived it after all. And then you\u2019re surprised by moments\
  \ like this.</p>"
