  \ with you. It would take about 10 minutes to do the interview on the phone. Just\
  \ need to set up a time and a phone number, for me to call so that we can do that,\
  \ what I do is I record it right on my computer and then I\u2019ll run it through\
  \ some professional editing software and then make it a good presentation for you.\
  \ So, give me a call please and we\u2019ll set up a time.</span></p>"
