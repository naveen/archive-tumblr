  \ has in its pipeline. As it stands now, I can easily imagine FourSquare replacing\
  \ Yelp \u2014 the way Yelp replaced CitySearch \u2014 to be the go-to source for\
  \ of location-specific information.</p>\n<p>In FourSquare\u2019s current state,\
  \ a possible monetization feature would allow vendors to offer targeted-promotions\
  \ to FourSquare players. Personally, I\u2019m very intrigued by how FourSquare has\
  \ successfully encouraged participation through egocentrism and virtual praise (titles,\
  \ badges, points) \u2014 they nailed it.\_ Moreover, I think they\u2019ve cleverly\
  \ applied game theory as a tactic to build a 100% user generated local resource.\_\
  \ That\u2019s pretty neat. What\u2019s in their pipeline?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://maximumalexbain.com/post/98865282/foursquare-ive-spent-far-too-much-time-thinking-about\"\
