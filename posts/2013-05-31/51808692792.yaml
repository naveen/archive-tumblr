caption: !!python/str "<p><strong>a personal API</strong></p>\n<p>i\u2019ve long been\
  \ a follower of the quantified self \u2013 even back before we started calling it\
  \ that and started building all this software behind it. when i was in graduate\
  \ school, i remember thinking i wasn\u2019t reading enough. so i made an effort\
  \ to cut through many must-read books (75). in two years of school, i tracked (microsoft\
  \ excel, as you do) each page read (21,278) and the number of days (622) and kept\
  \ a running log of pages-per-day (34.21). i got my goal of 10,000 pages a year and,\
  \ bonus!, i got through a few classics that still continue to be my favorite stories.</p>\n\
  <p>more recently, as i\u2019ve gotten older, i started getting more interested in\
  \ tracking my health and fitness. when we are young and in our twenties, we can\
  \ get away with pretty much anything. but like everyone else, the older i get, the\
  \ more i realize i only have one body \u2013 and that i should try to keep it tuned\
  \ to get the most performance out of it. i started at first by writing my workouts\
  \ down, and then trying out all types of digital trackers. one favorite tool that\
  \ came out of this period was the withings scale: it allowed me to periodically\
  \ keep track of trends in my weight and body composition and allowed me to think\
  \ about big trends in my life that affected performance.</p>\n<p>so far, i\u2019\
  ve used various tools and hacks over the years to collect this data. but i\u2019\
  ve long wanted it all in one place \u2013 or, at least, something to give me the\
  \ illusion of \u2018one place\u2019. a dataset that is a single repository and view\
  \ of my body as opposed to various silos of data scattered across different services\
  \ and devices. of course, this requires that we all play along in some way and make\
  \ our systems open and provide APIs for getting at this data. not only are we still\
  \ in the early stages of building such self awareness software, but so too are we\
  \ still some ways from designing the right data sets and figuring out ways to expose\
  \ them to our users. i believe the openness of the latter is just as important as\
  \ the first point and i think we still have some ways to go in that regard. (for\
  \ example, on many of the services i\u2019ve tried recently, i\u2019ve had to cobble\
  \ together and reverse engineer things to pull my own raw data out in some normalized\
  \ form).</p>\n<p>as a part of all these experiences, i\u2019ve always been curious\
  \ about the idea of a personal API \u2013 a 'quantified naveen\u2019 \u2013 that\
  \ would expose all of the information i knew about myself in a clean, open document.\
  \ i think i\u2019ve wanted to do this because:</p>\n<p>1) i wished to play with\
  \ the idea of a 'virtual me\u2019 that\u2019s entirely inside the machine;</p>\n\
  <p>2) the idea of a 'published\u2019, always-public me has intriguied me (we share\
  \ our tweets and checkins and photos and music habits to a wide audience, so why\
  \ not other types of behavior and habits as well?);</p>\n<p>3) and i\u2019ve been\
  \ curious what one might be able to do with such a resource: will any of it be useful\
  \ for research? might one create apps on top of me? or perhaps draw insights that\
  \ i haven\u2019t yet been able to see myself?</p>\n<p>as a way to start this off,\
  \ i\u2019ve put up an API of such personal data. i\u2019m calling it <a href=\"\
  http://api.naveen.com/\">api.naveen</a>. it currently exposes sleep, weight, steps,\
  \ fuel/activity and checkins. i aim to keep adding to this list with a few more\
  \ interesting ones as i think of them.</p>\n<p>have a look: <a href=\"http://api.naveen.com/\"\
  >http://api.naveen.com/</a></p>\n<p>drop me a note and let me know what else you\u2019\
  d like to see and what you end up doing with this. i welcome the start of a good\
  \ discussion.</p>\n<p>special thanks to: <a href=\"http://www.ericgfriedman.com/\"\
