  Rhythm_0.2C_1974\"><em>Rhythm 0,</em> 1974</span></h3>\n<p>To test the limits of\
  \ the relationship between performer and   audience, Marina Abramovi\u0107 developed\
  \ one of her most challenging (and   best-known) performances. She assigned a passive\
  \ role to herself, with   the public being the force which would act on her.</p>\n\
  <p>Abramovi\u0107 had placed upon a table 72 objects that people were allowed  \
  \ to use (a sign informed them) in any way that they chose. Some of  these  were\
  \ objects that could give pleasure, while others could be  wielded to  inflict pain,\
  \ or to harm her. Among them were scissors, a  knife, a  whip, and, most notoriously,\
  \ a gun and a single bullet. For  six hours  the artist allowed the audience members\
  \ to manipulate her  body and  actions.</p>\n<p>Initially, members of the audience\
  \ reacted with caution and modesty,   but as time passed (and the artist remained\
  \ impassive) several people   began to act quite aggressively. As Abramovi\u0107\
  \ described it later:</p>\n<p>\u201CThe experience I learned was that\u2026if you\
  \ leave decision to the   public, you can be killed.\u201D \u2026 \u201CI felt really\
  \ violated: they cut my   clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed\
  \ the gun at my   head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere.\
  \   After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward   the\
  \ public. Everyone ran away, escaping an actual confrontation.<sup class=\"reference\"\
