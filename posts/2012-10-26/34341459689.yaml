  \ more words into a note, i might\u2019ve said: it\u2019s sad to see where bookstores\
  \ and printed books themselves are heading, but i still have a fondness for them\
  \ both. i find there\u2019s still no better way to discover and learn about new\
  \ books than by walking into a well-curated store like shakespeare + co.</p>\n<p>*\
