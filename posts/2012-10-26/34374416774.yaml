  \ to leave new york city at first, but one morning i woke up and bought a one-way\
  \ ticket out of jfk. i took a single pack of the basics and three things i can\u2019\
  t seem to do without: the kindle, my notebook and my camera (\u201Cfuji-san\u201D\
  ). i spent the next two months moving around with no agenda, no itinerary and with\
  \ a series of one-way tickets in my pockets. the idea was to always keep moving,\
  \ to get more stamps in the passport, to stumble into new places: new york to zurich\
  \ to lucerne to geneva to yvoire to lyon to marseille to aix-en-provence to menerbes\
  \ to gordes to nice to saint tropez to saint-paul-de-vence to grasse to antibes\
  \ to monaco to barcelona to madrid to seville to cordoba to cadiz to tarifa to gibraltar\
  \ to tangier to lisbon to cascais to sintra to k\xF6ln to athens to sounion to vouliagmeni\
  \ to istanbul to beirut to amman to petra to tel aviv to jerusalem to mumbai to\
  \ delhi to jaipur to agra to paris and back again. along the way, i met some of\
  \ my old friends and, every so often, made new ones, but mostly i was alone with\
  \ my thoughts and my camera. and i took a lot of photographs, sometimes 300 a day\
  \ when things got really interesting. i\u2019m trying to learn to become a better\
  \ photographer and this journey provided the perfect backdrops in which to do that.</p>\n\
  <p>60 days on the road. 60 nights being away from home. it\u2019s nice to be back\
  \ in new york. it hasn\u2019t changed one bit, except to swap summer with the cool\
  \ taste of autumn.</p>"
