  >jayparkinsonmd</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I just finished reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Works-Anatomy-City-Kate-Ascher/dp/0143112708/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1295366407&amp;sr=1-1\"\
  >The Works</a> by Kate Ascher. If you\u2019ve ever wondered about how NYC works\u2014\
  \ what\u2019s under the streets, how clean water gets in the city and sewage is\
  \ removed, how bananas get from Ecuador to the corner bodega, this is the book for\
  \ you. Civil engineers focused on clean water and sanitary living conditions did\
  \ more for health than modern medicine will ever dream about. If it weren\u2019\
  t for them and their commitment to the public\u2019s health, we\u2019d still be\
  \ living in a very dismal world.</p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"http://www.unicefusa.org/news/releases/unicef-and-who-launch-report.html\"\
  >24,000 children die every day</a> in the developing world due to diarrhea from\
  \ dirty water and unsanitary living conditions.</p>\n<p>Did you know that 97% of\
  \ water consumed by New Yorkers reaches you by gravity. As long as you don\u2019\
  t live higher than the 6th floor, chances are your water flows naturally from the\
  \ reservoirs north of the city directly to your faucets\u2026amazing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
  <p>great book!</p>\n<p>everyone should have this one on their coffee table</p>"
