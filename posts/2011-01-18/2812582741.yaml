  \ offer this too. But I trust Twitter and Foursquare never to give the info to outsiders\

  \ a free service.</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>FYI: Foursquare will share\

  >http://foursquare.com/settings.</a> It\u2019s on the very top of the page, in a\
  \ hopefully very very easy to understand way.</p>\n<p>Also, as always, you can read\
