  \ Majors:</strong>\_Do you want to intern in NYC this summer (AKA the best way to\
  \ fall in love with the best city in the world)? Apply for a fellowship with the\_\
  <strong><a href=\"http://nycturingfellows.org/\">NYC Turing Fellows Program</a></strong>.\
  \ Applications open <em>today</em> and close on February 7th. They\u2019re being\
  \ reviewed on a rolling basis, so I would get your app in sooner rather than later.</p>\n\
  <p>There are some great companies on the list (including blip.tv, foursquare, and\
  \ tumblr) and it\u2019s an amazing opportunity to work in an amazing city. The $5000\
  \ stipend is pretty shiny, too. Don\u2019t miss this one, guys. Good luck!</p>\n\
  </blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m one of the organizers of the Turing Fellows program.\
  \  It\u2019s going to be fantastic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>do it.</p>"
