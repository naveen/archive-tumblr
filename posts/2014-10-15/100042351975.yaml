caption: !!python/str "<p><strong>Speaking.</strong><br/><br/> Voice has got to be\
  \ one of the most interesting things going right now. That felt weird to say. (I\
  \ recited some of this essay using Siri on my iPhone.)<br/><br/> I recited the essay\
  \ and the underlying ideas and then edited it in Quip on the desktop. I did think\
  \ about typing up this whole post speech-to-text and then hitting \u2018publish\u2019\
  , but punctuation is really hard for a computer to understand. Stream-of-consciousness\
  \ as a diary or in a text to your friend is nice, not so much on something to send\
  \ to the world.<br/><br/> I\u2019m really into the idea of using voice as command-line\
  \ and to transcribe short text messages and emails. I\u2019ve found this particularly\
  \ useful with the bigger iPhones which are difficult to hold and type using just\
  \ one hand. So I end up reciting text messages, occasionally quickly editing a missed\
  \ word if I have to and sending it along.<br/><br/> This just scratches the surface\
  \ in what\u2019s going on in voice technology now though.<br/><br/> Between:</p>\n\
  <p><span>\u2022 tools envisioning voice as command-line (see </span><a href=\"https://www.stonetemple.com/great-knowledge-box-showdown/\"\
  >Comparison of Knowledge Boxes in Siri/Google Now/Cortana</a><span>) and</span></p>\n\
  <p><span></span><span>\u2022 tools </span><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/10/1/voice-is-the-next-big-thing-in-mobile\"\
  >re-thinking voice calls</a><span> (see Talko and </span><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/08/confirmed-truecaller-scores-60-million-in-series-c-from-kpcb-atomico-and-sequoia/\"\
  >Trucaller</a><span>) and</span></p>\n<p><span></span><span>\u2022 hardware like\
  \ the straight-outta-'Her\u2019 Moto Hint and</span></p>\n<p><span></span><span>\u2022\
  \ features in chat apps to record-and-send voice (see new iMessages; they\u2019\
  re voice comms, but just not in real-time)</span></p>\n<p>there\u2019s something\
  \ really interesting afoot.<br/><br/> Bonus: Did you know: with the recent iPhones/iOS\
  \ out, when your iPhone is plugged in, you can start Siri by speaking \u201CHey\
  \ Siri\u201D. You needn\u2019t touch the home button to enable Siri, just start\
  \ speaking \u201CHey Siri\u201D followed by your command, whatever it is. \u2013\
  \ I wonder if someone on a major TV broadcast said \u201CHey Siri. Call Mom.\u201D\
  \ how many plugged in handsets across the country might actually start ringing up\
  \ moms.<br/><br/> Reminder: call your mom.</p>"
