caption: <p><span>Hello, this is a message for Jordan. You requested the loan to your
  question for the Joyce Theater in April 8th for the 8 PM performance. Just let you
  down for that and please give me a call back to confirm. At (646) NNN-NNNN the call
  time would be 7 PM, so one are probably before the show starts and the dress code
  is black dress pants, black shoes, and black fixed. Thank you very much. Have a
  good evening.</span></p>
