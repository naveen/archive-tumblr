  <blockquote>\n<p><strong>Checking Out Books? Check in on Foursquare.</strong></p>\n\
  <p>The New York Public Library is now on <a href=\"http://foursquare.com\">foursquare</a>.\
  \ Starting today, Library visitors can \u201Ccheck in\u201D from any of our locations\
  \ across The Bronx, Staten Island and Manhattan, proudly announcing their location\
  \ to their foursquare friends. If they check in a certain number of times, they\
  \ get the Find The Future Centennial Badge (seen above) which was designed in honor\
  \ of the 100th birthday of our landmark Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. NYPL is\
  \ the first public library to be awarded its own badge, and foursquare CEO and co-founder\
  \ Dennis Crowley said, \u201CThe NYPL\u2019s landmark building has been a New York\
  \ institution for 100 years, and it\u2019s pretty amazing to see them starting their\
  \ next 100 by embracing new ways to reach their fans. We hope the partnership will\
  \ introduce even more people to all the Library has to offer.\u201D So check it\
  \ out (and check in).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>YES!</p>"
