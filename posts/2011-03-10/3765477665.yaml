  <blockquote>\n<p>All aboard the 9:23 train to Banana Town.</p>\n<p>Foursquare and\
  \ Amex introduce a new kind of location-based Special.\_</p>\n<p>1. User connects\
  \ personal Amex card to foursquare account. Takes 20 seconds.\_</p>\n<p>2. Only\
  \ those users who opted-in see AMEX Specials when they check in at certain venues.\
  \ I see Specials. My VISA friend doesn\u2019t.\_</p>\n<p>3. Check in to unlock special.\
  \ Click \u201CLoad to Card\u201D on special.\_</p>\n<p>4. Swipe your card = SPECIAL\
  \ REDEEMED.\_</p>\n<p>American Express can run these Load to Card at any venue where\
  \ AMEX is accepted. It doesn\u2019t disturb or compete with the merchants\u2019\
  \ existing specials. One could argue that it will bring more customers into their\
  \ business.\_</p>\n<p>I tested this yesterday in New York. Had lunch at small restaurant\
  \ in East Village. Unlocked Special. Ate Roast Beef sando. Paid with AMEX. My Phone\
  \ PINGED me with the notification I saved $5 - <em>before the waitress even brought\
  \ the receipt back.\_</em></p>\n<p>Let me just come out and say it. This is sort\
  \ of a big deal.\_</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/03/10/amex-sxsw/\"\
