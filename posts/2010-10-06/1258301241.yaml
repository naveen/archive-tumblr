  <p>I kid. The office vibe at #36coop the last few days has been one of incredible\
  \ intensity on the Foursquare side of the sixth floor. It\u2019s impossible to overstate\
  \ how much they care, how hard they work, and how incredibly complex their challenges\
  \ are. I made the mistake of asking @harryh yesterday if he was happy \u2014 honestly,\
  \ it was a genuinely uncool and throwaway stupid thing to do \u2014 and I\u2019\
  m lucky he didn\u2019t rip my head off. He definitely considered it.</p>\n<p>Anyway,\
  \ so long as people could have checked-in at my funeral, all good.</p>\n</blockquote>"
