  \ Goodman<span>\_set out alone on my bike to make a photography project called\_\
  </span><span><strong>A Girl\u2019s Bike</strong></span><span>. In roughly 4 months\
  \ he documented close to 200 women and their bicycles around\_</span><span><strong>NYC</strong></span><span>,\
  \ mostly on the street as he found them. In 2008 it was made into a book published\
  \ by\_</span><span><strong>Partners &amp; Spade</strong></span><span>. It also toured\
  \ with the\_</span><span><strong>Bicycle Film Festival</strong></span><span>\_as\
  \ a slide show before films and in the art show\_</span><span><strong>Joy Ride</strong></span><span>.</span></p>\n\
