  \ I am sitting alone with my phone (sad panda) and have some time to kill, I log\
  \ into the anonymous internet: usually WUT and Secret.</p>\n<p>After spending most\
  \ of the last decade on services that need your actual identity, I\u2019ve been\
  \ curious about these services that allow you to leave your real names behind. I\
  \ think the late 90s were the last time I personally sought out services where I\
  \ was anonymous or pseudonymous. Ever since then, I\u2019ve been bringing together\
  \ my identity into one namespace (@naveen).</p>\n<p>One of the immediate benefits\
  \ in such services is that your words carry weight and legitimacy on their own.\
  \ You don\u2019t scan to see who posted it before deciding whether to start reading\
  \ it. Twitter democratized things in the sense that I could post something in the\
  \ same space (and potential audience) as someone else, but if he started with more\
  \ followers or a bigger brand than me, you would pay attention to and retweet his\
  \ post way more than mine (rich get richer). With these anonymous services, none\
  \ of that matters \u2013 your words are the only thing that\u2019s important and\
  \ they carry themselves.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you can use these services just to have\
  \ a public conversation of your thoughts. Perhaps these are like the things you\
  \ mutter to yourself in an empty room when you know no one else is listening. It\
  \ could be frustration; things you say out loud that you don\u2019t even realize\
  \ you are saying out loud; future conversation you\u2019re rolling around in your\
  \ head; &amp;c. (Oh god, I can\u2019t believe I just admitted that here like a crazy\
  \ person, but come on, surely others do this too.) I find that the majority of posts\
  \ on both services are of this nature: things that would otherwise probably have\
  \ never been captured.</p>\n<p>In the handful of times I\u2019ve used Secret, I\
  \ found I only posted things in order to maximize likes. That addictive dopamine\
  \ behavior that I like so much on other social services had made its way here as\
  \ well. It didn\u2019t matter that no one would know on Secret that I was the author,\
  \ but just knowing that whatever I posted was clever or funny (and other people\
  \ thought so) got me to post even more things. <em>Why do we create publicly anyway\
  \ if not to be validated?</em> I wonder if others think the same way. Further, I\
  \ wonder if others post things just to be provocative and to get hearts. If so,\
  \ the things you\u2019re posting on Secret then don\u2019t mean the same thing as\
  \ an honest message, and in some ways takes away from the authenticity. (I\u2019\
  ve noticed incredibly funny people on Twitter tend to do this too: make up stories\
  \ or anecdotes about someone they saw on the street but it just so happens not to\
  \ be true. Perhaps it\u2019s the <em>standup comic</em> way of telling a story.)</p>\n\
  <p>WUT doesn\u2019t have that problem. Because no one can give you the same kind\
  \ of feedback, beyond just responding to your message with another linearly, you\
  \ can\u2019t game the system for such events. Even if you post with the intention\
  \ of getting a response, there\u2019s no interface to show you and others watching\
  \ \u201CXX post of yours had NN hearts\u201D (or whatever).</p>\n<p>Sometimes, WUT\
  \ turns into a weird game of telephone. This is especially true of this service\
  \ over others in its class because there are no threads in WUT: no distinction between\
  \ posts and comments. Someone will say something, and others will take it and turn\
  \ it into some rhyme or repeated pattern.</p>\n<p>I recently moved WUT up higher\
  \ in the notifications drawer on iOS. It now sits immediately after Phone and Messages.\
  \ I thought this was very curious as I\u2019ve never consciously done this for any\
  \ application ever (even ones I am coding up and testing). I thought about this\
  \ for a while, and then realized I had to do this: WUT\u2019s primary interface\
  \ is not in the app, it\u2019s in the Notifications drawer. I think that\u2019s\
  \ the first time I\u2019ve ever had any app on my phone that used this view space\
  \ in that way.</p>\n<p>WUT messages remind me of early Twitter. In 2006 Twitter,\
  \ we would post whatever and whenever, free of a filter. It was weird: even though\
  \ all these posts were public and indexable by the internet, we posted as if only\
  \ our forty-five followers were ever listening. As we\u2019ve gotten older and more\
  \ people are listening, we have all come to filter ourselves and to start \u201C\
  creating brands around our identity.\u201D</p>\n<p>In more than a few cases, WUT\
  \ has also become early foursquare: \u201CSun\u2019s out; in Washington square park.\
  \ Who\u2019s around?\u201D</p>\n<p>Anyway, those are some things I think of when\
  \ I\u2019m fooling around with these services.</p>\n<p>Beyond these explorations,\
  \ I don\u2019t know what to make of these apps. What more can I do with them? How\
  \ long will the messages be new and exciting and not the same old stuff over and\
  \ over again? If it\u2019s the same old, I\u2019m likely to just stop using and\
  \ I think I am getting close. They\u2019re like games in that way: interesting only\
  \ when they have your attention and, right now, they have my attention.</p>"
