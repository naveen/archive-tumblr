caption: !!python/str "<p><strong>On tapping and talking.</strong></p>\n<p>There\u2019\
  s this (beautifully-designed!) new app I\u2019ve been playing with a lot these last\
  \ few weeks. It\u2019s called <a href=\"https://taptalk.me/\">Taptalk</a>.</p>\n\
  <p><span>It reminds me a lot of early Snapchat. You take a photo, maybe add some\
  \ text in there and pick a friend with whom to share. It also adds your location,\
  \ which I find fun because I can see immediately where around the world someone\
  \ is (my farthest away contact is in Australia, so it\u2019s refreshing to get street\
  \ photos from there). Unlike Snapchat, you can\u2019t send a single photo to a whole\
  \ bunch of people at once. But like Snapchat, when the other person gets your message,\
  \ it feels like a one-to-one, as if it was written just for them. Because a person\
  \ has to carefully craft the photo or video and then only send to one person at\
  \ a time, the receiver ends up assigning more value and paying more attention to\
  \ what you send them. One-to-many blasts in a feed, I\u2019ll scroll by, but knowing\
  \ you took time makes me want to take time, too.</span></p>\n<p><span>On first install,\
  \ you have to pick a username and then manually add friends based on username alone.\
  \ So this means a lot of word-of-mouth type spreading of the app. I originally found\
  \ out about it from friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mh\">@mh</a> in SF, who\
  \ sent me an invite via text.</span></p>\n<p><span>After sending a few taptalks\
  \ back and forth with him, I decided to play outside the boundaries of what the\
  \ app initially wanted people to do. I\u2019ve taken to doing some interesting experimentation\
  \ on this network.</span></p>\n<p><span>I didn\u2019t have the patience to add people\
  \ one at a time. I wanted to take a slightly different approach. So a couple of\
  \ months ago, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naveen/status/460831962824187904\">I\
  \ tweeted my taptalk username</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Over the next week or so,\
  \ just from this tweet and some other adds by friends, my contacts list grew to\
  \ about 36 people.</span></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019ve tweeted it a couple of <a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/naveen/status/464809562856755200\">more</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naveen/status/473918363266072576\"\
  >times</a> since and shared it with friends in person a few times, and now, my contact\
  \ list is 104 people! (I find about a third use it regularly).</span></p>\n<p><span>I\
  \ find the service fascinating for a few reasons, but I think the main reason is\
  \ because, after not caring about it for a while, I have a new fascination with\
  \ networks now. For a while, networks were becoming ever more public \u2013 your\
  \ posts are public to whomever wants to listen; followers instead of friends; get\
  \ followers to get likes; get likes to get engagement; get retweets to get followers.\
  \ See: Tumblr, Twitter, FB, Soundcloud, Youtube, &amp;c. Recently though, social\
  \ and the network are coming back to smaller, more curated groups.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>Taptalk\u2019s take on this is not only a network where you grow only by\
  \ sharing your username and thereby keeping your friends list very tight, but it\u2019\
  s one where you can \u201Cintroduce\u201D people to others. I love this feature.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>When you add a new contact, the app asks you to introduce them to others\
  \ you know that you might want them to know, too. Anytime this \u2018introduce\u2019\
  \ screen comes up, I find myself taking care to look through my contacts and put\
  \ interesting people together. Maybe something good will come out of their relationship,\
  \ maybe I\u2019ll get karma back in some way in future.</span></p>\n<p><span>If\
  \ I know the person, I carefully introduce them to others who I think they would\
  \ enjoy following and sharing with. Maybe a new founder will get intros to all my\
  \ other startup friends in New York; maybe they will also get intros to all my VC\
  \ friends on Taptalk.</span></p>\n<p><span>If I don\u2019t know the person (see\
  \ that part where I tweeted my username?), I introduce them to someone else in my\
  \ contacts list I don\u2019t know. Ha ha! I do this partly for the fun of it, but\
  \ also because I am wary that if I were to connect an \u201Cunknown\u201D with a\
  \ \u201Cknown\u201D and it\u2019s not a right fit, then it doesn\u2019t feel good\
  \ to me. I\u2019ll feel as though I\u2019ve let both of them down as nothing might\
  \ come out of it.</span></p>\n<p><span>(Sorry contacts I don\u2019t know: I\u2019\
  m experimenting here!)</span></p>\n<p><span>One funny thing I noticed today: a person\
  \ I follow on Taptalk sent me a photo of some headphones, which was a taptalk in\
  \ reply to a tweet I sent this morning asking for headphone recommendations. Maybe\
  \ it was easier for him to take a photo of the headphones by just tapping my face.\
  \ After all, how much simpler can a photo share flow get than Taptalk? A photo gets\
  \ taken and sent in one tap of a face to the person you want. (The alternative is\
  \ to take a photo, launch Twitter, put it in there, put some tweet text around it\
  \ and then @-reply me).</span></p>\n<p><span>Much has been written about Slingshot,\
  \ especially in the context of Taptalk. At first glance, it feels like a lot of\
  \ the same stuff that\u2019s in Taptalk, with some tweaks like some Snapchat mixed\
  \ in and an interesting way to get people to share more (share to play). But it\u2019\
  s those tweaks that really bother me. I currently have 132 photos to go through\
  \ in Slingshot. That\u2019s great, but that means I have to swipe 132 items to see\
  \ them all. That\u2019s broken. It reminds me of Jelly, if your question ever gets\
  \ a lot of responses as one of mine did: I had to swipe ~200 times to see all answers.\
  \ There was no easy way to scan and browse and get proper value out of it without\
  \ giving it even more time than I\u2019d already had. The other annoying thing about\
  \ Slingshot is that it has turned into a bit of \u201Cgive junk to get junk\u201D\
  . That is, in order to see the photos available to them locked in queue, many people\
  \ have just taken to taking a photo of some random nonsense to get access. So over\
  \ time, junk photos get sent to see photos, most of which are junk too, because\
  \ the other friend thought the same and did the same: give junk to get junk.</span></p>\n\
