caption: !!python/str "<p><span>\n<p>this is a bit of a brain dump of a post (\xA1\
  que formatting!).</p>\n<p>i\u2019ve been talking about the nyc marathon non-stop\
  \ for the last couple of months.</p>\n<p>it\u2019s my first marathon so friends\
  \ that have run it in the past have offered up good hacks and i figured i should\
  \ share. i have a pretty good memory but i\u2019m paraphrasing some of these as\
  \ i don\u2019t remember exact words. but i think the idea from each person comes\
  \ through with its original meaning.</p>\n<p>+ trust me: you\u2019ll want to write\
  \ your name on your shirt. i still remember when some women in queens yelled out:\
  \ \u201CGO! NUH-DEE-UH! GO!\u201D (nadia)</p>\n<p>+ bring a plastic sheet to sit\
  \ on in staten island. you have to sit for a long time from the time you arrive\
  \ to when the race starts and you\u2019ll want to sit down. the grass could be cold\
  \ and wet and you don\u2019t want soggy bottoms (superkb)</p>\n<p>+ bring something\
  \ warm to wear to staten island. bring an extra sweatshirt to throw on \u2013 one\
  \ that you can then throw away later as you start the race (emilyg)</p>\n<p>+ lube\
  \ up your toes with vaseline (arainert)</p>\n<p>+ if you have to run the lower level\
  \ of the verrazano, try not to run along the edges. some people love to, um, pee\
  \ off the upper level (gillian)</p>\n<p>+ if you really have to, swap clothes in\
  \ greenpoint (arainert)</p>\n<p>+ coming off 59th street is like no other: it\u2019\
  s so quiet as you run that all you hear are each others\u2019 footsteps. all of\
  \ a sudden you get to 1st avenue and there\u2019s a throng of people cheering and\
  \ yelling and it\u2019s the loudest thing in the world (dispete)</p>\n<p>+ don\u2019\
  t take it too seriously and take it all in. i used to write \u201Csmile\u201D on\
  \ my hand, whenever i got stressed or tired i would remind myself to have fun (dispete)</p>\n\
  <p>some of the biggest, but most important, tips come from chad: just have fun with\
  \ it, high-five some kids. \u201Cyou\u2019re going to run the greatest race in the\
  \ world\u201D. he got me these cool\_<a href=\"http://sheddableshell.com/\">tearaways</a>\_\
  (what up, patrick ewing!) that should come in handy in the morning</p>\n<p>the \u201C\
  have your name on your shirt\u201D will go a long way, i think. i remember this\
  \ trick from high school track: everyone at school knew you and gave you a reason\
  \ to keep the pace up. there has to something special about having all of new york\
  \ shout out your name</p>\n<p>some others i\u2019d add:</p>\n<p>+ wear something\
  \ nice. haha. (wear something you\u2019re used to running in)</p>\n<p>+ don\u2019\
  t bring anything you don\u2019t absolutely need (or bring something you can pass\
  \ off to a friend in case it gets to be a bother)</p>\n<p>+ use anti-chafe and wear\
  \ bandaids (where? you figure it out!)</p>\n<p>+ have someone bring flip flops that\
  \ you can wear after the race (this is a genius move; you\u2019ll thank me later)</p>\n\
  <p>anything else? add them as comments.</p>\n<p>i\u2019m still raising money for\
  \ campinteractive and just a little shy of my goal. i\u2019d love your donation:\_\
