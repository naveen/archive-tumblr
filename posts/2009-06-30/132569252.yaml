  \ Pappas, the man who taught me more about venture capital than anyone else also\
  \ taught me a lot about marriage. When we got married, I was working for Milton.\
  \ When our first child, Jessica, was born, he told me, \u201Cmake one night a week\
  \ date night. do it every week without fail. and when you are alone, don\u2019t\
  \ talk about the daily grind, talk about your hopes and dreams, what you want to\
  \ do together and what you will do together\u201D. That was very sage advice. I\
  \ must admit that I don\u2019t practice it enough, but I do practice it (like many\
  \ things in my life).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/06/building-successful-long-term-relationships.html\"\
