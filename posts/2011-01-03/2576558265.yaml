  >small, dark and gritty, albatross in omoide (\u201Cmemory lane\u201D aka piss alley)\
  \ is easily one of my favorite spots in tokyo</a></p>\n<p>in shinjuku</p>\n<p>and\
  \ as far as small, dark and gritty alleys go, omoide is one of my favorites too</p>\n\
  <p>most interesting part about this place: from the second floor, you can order\
  \ and pass drinks through that hole in the floor to the first floor (drops into\
  \ the bar)</p>"
