  \ history</a></p>\n<p>the first time I wanted to find this place (2006), I stumbled\
  \ into it just as I was about to give up and go home</p>\n<p>this time around, I\
  \ knew to look for it, but still got lost, then literally \u201Clooked up\u201D\
  \ to see the building</p>\n<p>love the arcade machines on the fifth floor (not for\
  \ sale, as far as I can tell, but you can play all sorts of classics, mostly JPN)</p>\n\
  <p>the other floors have all sorts of games and consoles (famicon, neogeo, nes,\
  \ genesis, \u2026) all shrink-wrapped for your collecting pleasure</p>"
