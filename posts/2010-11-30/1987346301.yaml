  \ wild. :) Our friends at the GAP put some \u201Cadd to foursquare\u201D button\
  \ love in their banner ads for the holiday season. The ads are totally interactive.\
  \ Theyll either recognize my location and suggest GAP locations nearby (where you\
  \ can add the item or a deal to your \u201Cto do\u201D list) or allow me to change\
  \ my location to add my \u201Cto-do\u201D at a GAP further away.\_</p>\n<p>For this\
  \ one, you can add a \u201Cto-do\u201D reminding you to take advantage of a 30%\
  \ off deal. See <a href=\"http://yfrog.com/ncr20p\">here</a>\_</p>\n<p>I\u2019d\
  \ love to see this on every retail website out there. It\u2019s the offline \u201C\
  like\u201D button and makes a TON of sense. GAP, you are awesome.</p>\n<p>p.s. thanks\
