  <blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>An evolution of foursquare design from January\
  \ 2009 - August 2011</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the great things about\
  \ working on one product is the ability to iterate; the bad thing is you never feel\
  \ like you\u2019re done.\_</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When foursquare started there was\
  \ no real visual design on the app. Naveen was coding it up alone and he used all\
  \ native Apple UI elements. I was helping out on the side and slowly we added custom\
  \ elements and branding and for SXSW 2010 we did our first visual pass at the design.\
  \ At that point I was doing everything, and it showed. One person can only do so\
  \ much. Now we have a talented group of UI and UX designers and these days I mostly\
  \ work on the iOS app. <br/><br/>We just put out a new build complete with a new\
  \ blue navigation bar, photos inline, single tap cells and a newly designed check-in\
  \ detail screen. I\u2019m really proud of this current iteration of the app and\
  \ can\u2019t wait to see it continue to evolve.\_</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"\
