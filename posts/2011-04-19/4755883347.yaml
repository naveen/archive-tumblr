caption: !!python/str "<p>LONDON\u2014World-renowned news and opinion magazine The\
  \ Economist announced plans to suspend any new online and print content for the\
  \ next month in an effort to finally allow subscribers a chance to catch up. \u201C\
  It\u2019s only fair to our readers,\u201D said Economist editor Winthrop Parker,\
  \ adding that there was no reason for subscribers to feel ashamed for not necessarily\
  \ knowing every last detail about the current economic and geopolitical climate.\
  \ \u201CEven just scanning over some of the feature stories can sometimes take two\
  \ or three daily bus commutes to finish. After all, some of these issues have as\
  \ many words in them as a short novel. No one should be expected to do that in one\
  \ week.\u201D In related news, ESPN The Magazine announced Monday it would be suspending\
  \ publication indefinitely until its readers learned to read.</p>"
