  \ was thought up primarily for the folowing use case. Someone is at a new restaurant\
  \ and deciding what to order. They type in the name of the place on their mo-bile\
  \ and browse recommendations. Right from the browser! No download/account needed.\
  \ Think of it as a minimalist shortcut. Don\u2019t forget to all the site to grab\
