caption: !!python/str "<p><strong>Expa</strong></p>\n<p>I am excited to announce that\
  \ I am joining <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gmc\">Garrett</a> and\_<a href=\"http://expa.com/\"\
  >Expa</a> as a partner based in New York City. Expa is a startup studio that works\
  \ with founders to develop and launch new companies. We have a few things in the\
  \ works already at Expa HQ in SoMa. I will be helping on all these existing projects.\
  \ And soon, I will launch some new products based in SoHo. We plan to work on just\
  \ a few companies at a time, with our focus directed at areas we love and in which\
  \ we have deep experience: mobile, platforms and marketplaces.</p>\n<p><span>I spent\
  \ much of the last year tinkering, reading and learning as much as I could from\
  \ others. In all these explorations and sketches, one desire stood out: I want to\
  \ create things that are good for the web. I want to leave the internet in a better\
  \ place than I found it. With this new model in Expa and with a great team behind\
  \ us, I hope to bring a lot of these ideas to life.</span></p>\n<p><span>We\u2019\
  re always looking for great engineers, designers and product minds to come join\
  \ us. I\u2019d love to work with you on our new projects both here in New York as\
  \ well as in San Francisco, so please get in touch at <a href=\"http://join@expa.com\"\
  >join@expa.com</a>.</span></p>"
