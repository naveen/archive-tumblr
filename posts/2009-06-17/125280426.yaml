  >msg</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m fascinated by the abandoned City Hall subway\
  \ stop (in addition to all things historic in NYC). I really want to stay on the\
  \ 6 train at Brooklyn Bridge and ride the loop when the train does its little turnaround\
  \ to go back uptown.</p>\n<p>The station\_was in service from 1904-1945. It was\
  \ closed down because it would have been too difficult to extend the platform around\
  \ the sharp curve since the station was essentially one big loop. Read and see more\
  \ pictures <a href=\"http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/stations?5:979\">here</a>.</p>\n\
