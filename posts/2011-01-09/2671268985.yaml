  >slavin</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I used to think about the connections between psychedelic\
  \ ephemera, rave culture, myspace and l33t, about how subculture (such as it is)\
  \ always finds way to live in the ecosystem with public secrets. Visible to everyone,\
  \ but only legible to them who should read it.</p>\n<p>And then you read this about\
  \ Comic Sans, and I wonder if the easiest to way to hide something in public is\
  \ to make it way too easy to read.\_</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Last week, science writer\
  \ and editor Christian Jarrett\_<a href=\"http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2010/12/harder-to-read-fonts-boost-student.html\"\
  >blogged about</a>\_a new\_<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2010.09.012\"\
  >study</a>, published this month in<em>Cognition</em>. The researchers, led by Connor\
  \ Diemand-Yauman, asked 28 student volunteers to read about hypothetical alien species\
  \ from a sheet printed in either 16-point Arial, 12-point Bodoni, or, yes, 12-point\
  \ Comic Sans. The larger Arial font was much more legible than the other two versions,\
  \ but in a quiz 15 minutes later, students reading the Bodoni or Comic Sans versions\
  \ were significantly more accurate in recalling details about the aliens.</p>\n\
  <p>In a follow-up, in collaboration with an Ohio high school, the researchers made\
  \ actual classroom handouts less legible, either by setting them in smaller, harder-to-read\
  \ fonts (including Haettenschweiler, Monotype Corsiva, and once again, Comic Sans),\
  \ or by moving them around while duplicating them on a copy machine. Once again,\
  \ out of a pool of 220 participating students, those who studied from the less-legible\
  \ materials did better on tests than those with more-legible handouts.</p>\n</blockquote></blockquote>"
