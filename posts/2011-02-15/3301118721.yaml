  \ <a href=\"http://ui-patterns.com/\">ui-patterns.com</a> for looking at UI and\
  \ design inspiration for websites. However the majority of my work revolves around\
  \ mobile now and I haven\u2019t found anything quite like these sites for iphone\
  \ and Android apps. There are countless blog entries about best practices, but no\
  \ full libraries.\_<span>The best thing to do is just look at the actual apps, hold\
  \ them in your hand and see how the interaction works. I take a ton of screen shots\
  \ of apps every day, but there isn\u2019t an easy way to access those screen shots\
  \ in my photo album and from various computers later on. \u201CWhere was that really\
  \ good screen shot of the new user EDU in that one app?\u201D Suddenly I\u2019m\
  \ scrolling through hundreds of photos.\_</span><span>\_</span></p>\n<p>To solve\
  \ this problem I\u2019ve created a mobile pattern library of all my screenshots\
  \ (well most of them). This is only halfway complete and mainly just for myself,\
  \ but I thought I would share for any UI designers stuck on a particularly tricky\
  \ problem and looking for inspiration.</p>\n<p>Take a look:\_<br/><a href=\"http://mobile-patterns.com/\"\
