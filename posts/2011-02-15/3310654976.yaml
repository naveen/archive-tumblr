  \ of Buildings. Historians believe 35 Cooper Square was born in 1825. The oldest\
  \ building on Cooper Square, and one of the oldest buildings of the original Bowery,\
  \ this charming Federal style building with the traditional gambrel roof, twin-pedimented\
  \ dormers, and large end chimneys also boasts historical and cultural associations\
  \ ranging from a direct descendant of Peter Stuyvesant to much later habitation\
  \ by Diane DiPrima, the most influential woman of the Beat Generation. (via <a href=\"\
