  \ takes us just far enough away to see how our fair city, even on the dreariest\
  \ of days, can be an elegant backdrop for the glimpses of greenery that our great\
  \ parks provide. There\u2019s something incongruous about how vibrant and lush the\
  \ trees are, set against the seemingly inhospitable streets and buildings of NYC.\
  \ But it\u2019s kind of like NYers in a way: brusque and businesslike, maybe even\
  \ hard-edged at the surface, but infinitely and unexpectedly various once you pass\
  \ through its gates. </em></p>\n<p>(via <a href=\"http://www.20x200.com/email/edition-announcement-316-joseph-o-holmes.html\"\
