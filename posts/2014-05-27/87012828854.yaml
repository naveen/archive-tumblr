caption: !!python/str "<p><strong>First things first</strong></p>\n<p><span>I love\
  \ Larry Page\u2019s \u201Ctoothbrush test\u201D. The toothbrush test goes like this:\
  \ a service passes the test if it is useful enough and important enough that people\
  \ will use it at least once or twice per day. I believe Page was using this as a\
  \ test for companies Google should be looking to acquire. This test can be applied\
  \ to all sorts of services: social, utility, search, mail, productivity, messaging,\
  \ communications, networking, security, home, wearables, internet of things, &amp;c.\
  \ What an incredibly clever way to summarize how valuable a service truly is.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>A smaller variation of such a test is perhaps one I woke up with last week:\
  \ your first service of the day. This won\u2019t work for all types of services,\
  \ and likely is only good for messaging, social networks and some types of personal\
  \ productivity apps.</span></p>\n<p>A week ago on Tuesday morning, I asked on Twitter\
  \ \u201C<a href=\"https://twitter.com/naveen/status/468731596799881216\">What\u2019\
  s the first app you launch when you wake up in the morning? (Mine is Mail.)</a>\u201D\
  </p>\n<p><span>I don\u2019t know if it was the time I posted this tweet or if it\u2019\
  s something enough people felt connected enough to and wanted to answer, but I got\
  \ a lot of responses. I got sixty-six replies on Twitter, which might be more than\
  \ I\u2019ve ever gotten on any tweet in the past. Incidentally, even though this\
  \ same question was automatically cross-posted to Facebook, I got no replies at\
  \ all there. (I\u2019ve got more than a thousand friends there, and more than twenty-five\
  \ thousand followers, which is roughly the number of followers I\u2019ve got on\
  \ Twitter as well.)</span></p>\n<p><span>The Twitter responses I did get were interesting\
  \ and varied enough so I decided to tally them and write them up here. This is nothing\
  \ scientific, this is not a representation of any age group or background. If anything,\
  \ it\u2019s just what my Twitter followers, many of whom are already in the tech\
  \ world, have as their number one.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 aeropress<br/>1\
  \ calculator<br/>1 circa<br/>1 cliq<br/>1 clock<br/>1 fitbit<br/>1 forecast.io<br/>1\
  \ frontback<br/>1 kiggit1<br/>1 meditation<br/>1 messages<br/>1 nytimes<br/>1 okcupid<br/>1\
  \ on purpose<br/>1 shower<span><br/>1 soundcloud<br/></span>1 timehop<br/>1 twitterific<br/>1\
  \ vine<br/>1 weather<br/>1 whatsapp<br/>1 zite/flipboard<span><br/>2 calendar<br/></span><span>2\
  \ sleepcycle<br/></span><span>2 tumblr<br/></span><span>3 mailbox<br/></span><span>3\
  \ tweetbot<br/></span><span>5 gmail<br/></span><span>5 notifications<br/></span><span>6\
  \ mail<br/></span><span>7 twitter<br/></span><span>9 instagram</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\
  <p><span>I was expecting Whatsapp and Messages and other messaging apps to be ranked\
  \ number one, but perhaps messaging is just too fragmented across too many different\
  \ apps, depending on who\u2019s in your circle and where you live. It\u2019s also\
  \ entirely possible Messaging apps are all sitting in Notifications anyway - which\
  \ is why that gets the number four spot in this list. (Add up all the different\
  \ messaging apps that I got as replies, and that count goes up to seven\u2026in\
  \ second place).</span></p>\n<p><span>Four were sleep and clock-related (fitbit,\
  \ clock and sleepcycle) \u2013 it makes sense that the first thing you\u2019d do\
  \ when you wake up is to turn off the alarm or let your sleep tracker know you had\
  \ woken up.</span></p>\n<p><span>From an individual branded-app perspective, Instagram\
  \ makes a solid appearance in the number one spot with nine votes. But if you tally\
  \ up all the different ways one gets at Twitter (the main app, 7; tweetbot, 3; twitterific,\
  \ 1), you find it passes IG with 11 votes.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you tally up\
  \ all the ways to get at e-mail, it takes the number one spot with 14 picks overall.\
  \ Nothing will ever unseat e-mail; our children will be using it and our children\u2019\
  s children will be on it forevermore.</span></p>\n<p><span>I was expecting weather\
  \ apps (forecast.io) and news (New York Times, Flipboard) to rank more highly, but\
  \ perhaps that doesn\u2019t happen until you get going with breakfast and you\u2019\
  re getting dressed and leaving home. In a way, it\u2019s possible the overall number\
  \ one and two (E-mail and Twitter) serve some part of this \u201Cnews\u201D need:\
  \ a lot of how we consume the news comes at us in the form of newsletter summaries\
  \ like Quartz and via tweets from what friends are reading.</span></p>\n<p><span>Given\
  \ that the first thing you do in the morning might be \u201Creactive\u201D (shut\
  \ off the clock; look through notifications from the night before; when\u2019s my\
  \ first calendar event; do i have any pressing emails I need to attend before my\
  \ shower; &amp;c.), I wonder if I should have instead asked for both your first\
  \ and your second picks. The second might actually end up being an interesting choice\
  \ in itself: I suspect we might see things like Timehop (my second) ranked higher.</span></p>"
