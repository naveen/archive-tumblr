  <p><span>News organizations reporting from Benghazi said that a fighter jet was
  shot down on the outskirts of the city. It was not immediately clear whether the
  plane belonged to attacking Qaddafi forces or the rebels, or how it had been shot
  down. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/world/africa/20libya.html?hp">NYT</a>)</span></p>
