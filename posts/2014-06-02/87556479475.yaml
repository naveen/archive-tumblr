  \ future. AKA, 2015. Maybe even late 2014, you guys.</p>\n<p>6:30am. Good morning.</p>\n\
  <p>I wake up to the vibrate of my Misfit Shine / Jawbone UP / smart mattress (choose\
  \ your own adventure).</p>\n<p>I get out of bed and pick up my phone. It\u2019s\
  \ already synced my sleep data to the cloud before I know what\u2019s what (that\
  \ Bluetooth LE magic). Perhaps this has happened through my iPhone. Perhaps it\u2019\
  s happened through my new Apple TV. It doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s so smooth.\
  \ I love this combination of \u201Cthat thing I\u2019m wearing\u201D paired with\
  \ \u201Cthe thing already in the room\u201D \u2013 it makes for the richest and\
  \ most meaningful interactions.</p>\n<p>Oh, it knew when to wake me up because it\
  \ knew my first event in the morning was a 7AM bike ride. It knows my calendar too,\
  \ obviously.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a warm summer day in New York City. So Nest has already\
  \ picked up on this and woken up with me at the appropriate time with the right\
  \ temperature. It\u2019s no longer that cool night, so it turns up the aircon, as\
  \ the weather is already getting a bit muggy out.</p>\n<p>I go out for a ride on\
  \ my Specialized, which is my bike that has been plugged in and syncing and downloading\
  \ new training paths for me via Strava. It suggests a new route for me to hit: it\
  \ knows my training plan, after all. The wheels automatically track my distance\
  \ and cadence and power output and, paired with my phone, tracks GPS paths. My Apple\
  \ headphones, of course, track my heart rate. I head back home, lean my bike up\
  \ again the wall - of course, she syncs automatically to my \u201Chome\u201D.</p>\n\
  <p>I get showered and ready and iPhone has already pulled up the weather report\
  \ to show me. I\u2019ve not been touching the phone for the last 20 minutes, so\
  \ it already knows from habit that I\u2019ve been away on the shower and shave in\
  \ the morning.</p>\n<p>As soon as I leave home, my phone automatically informs the\
  \ other devices that want to know I\u2019ve left. My Apple TV pauses music that\
  \ was playing. Apple TV turns off all the lights and draws the shades. Separately,\
  \ Nest knows I\u2019m gone and goes into Away mode to conserve energy.</p>\n<p>If\
  \ anything should happen during my day at work that needs my attention, Home.app\
  \ will send me a notification. Otherwise, I head home after a long day and the home\
  \ system, knowing I\u2019m there, automatically warms all systems up. When I walk\
  \ in, my phone connects to WiFi and BLE, so all systems know it\u2019s me and turn\
  \ on all appropriate services.</p>\n<p>I sit on my couch and listen to some Beats\
  \ situation directly from an Apple TV app (after all these years, we have streaming\
  \ music as an app right on Apple TV).</p>\n<p>Then, I pick up a game controller\
  \ and play a few circuits worth of racing on my Apple TV, which has all the games\
  \ I purchased on iOS (yes!\u2013where I finally get to race on the big screen that\
  \ R8 I picked up on my iPhone).</p>\n<p>It\u2019s late.</p>\n<p>I fall asleep on\
  \ my couch.</p>\n<p>Apple Watch already knows my heart rate\u2019s in sleep mode\
  \ and falls asleep with me (Oh wow, I love this idea of devices \u201Cfalling asleep\
  \ with me\u201D).</p>\n<p>Of course, it already knows when to wake me up the next\
  \ morning, so I need not worry about setting an alarm.</p>\n<p>Good night.</p>"
