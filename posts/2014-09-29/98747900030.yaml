  Oh, snap\u2019 moment this weekend about Snapchat. (Sorry, I had to.)</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>I don\u2019t use Snapchat much because my friends don\u2019t use it. We\u2019\
  re probably old. *sigh*.\_</span><span>But then, a few things happened recently\
  \ that got me back on it.</span></p>\n<p><span>First, I started following a couple\
  \ of photographer friends who have been posting stories on Snapchat. I imagine they\
  \ need something like Snapchat to show a 'behind-the-scenes\u2019 into their lives.\
  \ All other networks they use require them to be professional, to show that every\
  \ photo they take is carefully crafted and better than any you could take. But Snapchat\
  \ allows them to capture and share as the rest of us do: a behind-the-scenes where\
  \ the output isn\u2019t being held to a standard, where the lighting doesn\u2019\
  t matter, where they don\u2019t have to behave as if they are contributing to a\
  \ portfolio of work.</span></p>\n<p><span>Then, during Jeter\u2019s last game here\
  \ in New York, I came across stories from other people under the 'Live\u2019 category.\
  \ It was actually quite a magical moment to be able to see snaps from all around\
  \ Yankee Stadium from all sorts of people. What did the moment mean to them? What\u2019\
  s it like to be there in their shoes? It allowed me to live the last game through\
  \ not only traditional TV, but the simultaneous multicast of so many people who\
  \ were at the event. Imagine if you were watching a live show on TV and the picture-in-picture\
  \ showed these snaps from different perspectives. That\u2019s what that felt like.\
  \ The experience to me was much different than following a hashtag on Twitter, because\
  \ 'Live\u2019 is curated and auto-plays all snaps shared. As Snapchat themselves\
  \ says: \u201C<a href=\"http://blog.snapchat.com/post/96103104325/its-live\">The\
  \ world has never experienced this before - it\u2019s truly a product of the Snapchat\
  \ community.</a>\u201D</span></p>\n<p><span>After these experiences, I started thinking\
  \ of Snapchat more when out and about.</span></p>\n<p><span>At the Global Citizen\
  \ Festival this Saturday in Central Park, I started using Snapchat all day. I saw\
  \ many kids holding up their phones and capturing the concert, so I figured it was\
  \ a perfect place for me to try Stories and use it as they would. There\u2019s something\
  \ about using Snapchat as opposed to your default camera app to capture the concert.\
  \ For one, photos of the stage you take on your normal camera roll probably aren\u2019\
  t likely to get seen more than the first time. They are also likely to be boring:\
  \ dark, low-res, with weird angles of the stage and with people\u2019s hands and\
  \ phones and backs in the frame. But, for the course of the day, it\u2019s nice\
  \ to let everyone in on your moment and what you\u2019re seeing. They get a quick\
  \ glimpse of where you\u2019re standing and experiencing and that is enough.</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>I found myself not really using Snapchat\u2019s send-to-friend feature.\
  \ In the heat of the moment, it required too many \_buttons to click and too much\
  \ decision making. To whom should I send this snap? Why did I choose that person?\
  \ All I wanted was to capture a scene and, if my friends saw it, then so be it;\
  \ if they didn\u2019t, that was okay too. No competing for likes, no getting stats\
  \ on how many friends viewed it. It doesn\u2019t mean I was capturing for \u201C\
  just me\u201D - but if friends saw it, I knew it would no doubt* be a conversation\
  \ piece for the next time we got together.</span></p>\n<p><span>As someone that\
  \ likes to take photos and loves time-hopping back into my past, Snapchat and products\
  \ like it make me realize that 99% of the photos I take never get seen anyway. Many\
  \ of them are just bad photos. For every 20 or so photos I take of a particular\
  \ scene, I post one publicly (like here on Tumblr). All those photos and videos\
  \ captured at the concert all shaky-cam-like didn\u2019t need to be saved, they\
  \ just needed to be seen. And then they needed to go away. There were very few photos\
  \ that I wanted to capture to look back on and when I had those, the rest was just\
  \ about sending along my moments.</span></p>\n<p><span>This Stories moment in the\
  \ evolution of the product reminds me of 2006 when Facebook launched Newsfeed. It\
  \ fundamentally changes how you use the product and why you come back to it day\
  \ after day. You don\u2019t use Snapchat like you used to, by choosing people with\
  \ whom to share. You just use stories - you create your own and you view the stories\
  \ of others. Likewise, with Facebook pre-Newsfeed, you had to go to everyone\u2019\
  s walls to see what photo they had changed and who was posting on what; post-Newsfeed:\
  \ well, it brought the updates to you.</span></p>\n<p><span>Interestingly, as Facebook\
  \ is attempting to go more and more ephemeral with their Labs experiments, Snapchat\
  \ is actually moving the other way towards becoming more permanent in a sense. It\
  \ still holds onto the idea that photos and videos probably don\u2019t need to last\
  \ longer than 24 hours because you never really go back to look at those things\
  \ anyway. Facebook, algorithmically, is the same way: you jump into Newsfeed, see\
  \ what\u2019s what today for everyone and then you leave. You can\u2019t go to Newsfeed\
  \ and collectively see what happened with your friends last week. Snapchat doesn\u2019\
  t save them past a day because there\u2019s no need to do that for the majority\
  \ of photos and videos we create casually: we are creating more than we will ever\
  \ be able to consume.</span></p>\n<p><span>* See what I did there? yeah, 'No Doubt\u2019\
  \ was on stage too.</span></p>"
