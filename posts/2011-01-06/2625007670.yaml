  >smallgirls</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>How Foursquare has made me fall in\
  \ love with Duane Reade, my neighborhood and everything ever.</strong></p>\n<p><a\
  \ href=\"http://foursquare.com\">FOURSQUARE</a> IS A MIGHTY POWER OF AWESOME THAT\
  \ SHINES DOWN NUGGETS OF GEO-POWER AND BRIGHTLY COLORED FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS ON\
  \ ALL THOSE WHO USE IT.</p>\n<p>Now that that\u2019s out of my system, here is the\
  \ deal: I just moved from Manhattan to Brooklyn, and despite the fact that I am\
  \ an video-game-playing, twee-listening twenty-something, have had an office here\
  \ for months now and even once offered a spoof tour of Williamsburg for Japanese\
  \ tourists, I know remarkably little about the area.</p>\n<p>Probably also related\
  \ to the fact that I am a video-game-playing, twee-listening twenty-something, I\
  \ can\u2019t really cook and/or fend myself, so would probably live on pizza and\
  \ french fries for all time if my body wouldn\u2019t kill me before reaching \u2018\
  for all time.\u2019 \_Moving to a new neighborhood means not having any idea where\
  \ to eat, which for me, means being really hungry (though shout out to\_<a href=\"\
  http://seamlessweb.tumblr.com\">seamless web</a>\_for keeping me from starving in\
  \ moments of delivery desperation.)</p>\n<p>However, one click on any nearby venue\u2019\
  s Foursquare notes and I am THE COOLEST, MOST INFORMED KID ON THE BLOCK. Why yes\
  \ I DO want to catch a dance party while eating Thai food after 10pm by checking\
  \ out SEA Thai. VICTORY!\_<em>AND</em>\_I knew in advance to BYOB to La Nonna Pizzeria\
  \ by getting a bottle of red down the street at UVA before bringing my date. HUZZAH\
  \ AGAIN FOURSQUARE!\_</p>\n<p>What\u2019s MOST awesome about Foursquare and my new\
  \ neighborhood, however, is captured in the above glorious image. There is a dual-floor\
  \ Duane Reade down the block from me. Yep, that\u2019s awesome enough in itself,\
  \ but not the point. As I was leaving there yesterday, I noticed on my phone a $10\
  \ gift card for all check-ins. \_I sighed to the clerk helping me with my departure\
  \ movie rental that I was one hour, two floors, three baskets, and $100 too late\
  \ to use the discount and he promptly opened the cash drawer and handed me the above\
  \ bill with a smile and a shrug.</p>\n<p><strong>I WAS PAID $10 CASH FOR USING FOURSQUARE</strong>.\
  \ TALK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA PAYING-OFF, PEOPLE. Plus, I\u2019m about to frame this\
  \ photo and kiss it before bed every night, so Duane Reade won, too. They won my\
  \ heart. They are now my boyfriend. They proved it by sending me a foursquare friend\
  \ request later (I accepted that thing so hard.)</p>\n<p>ILU, Lil Duane.</p>\n<p>xo,</p>\n\
