caption: !!python/str "<p><b>did i ever tell you about the time i pranked everyone\
  \ into thinking i was an actor in the new york television festival party?:</b> they\
  \ had a mini red carpet thing and cameras and everything. some cameraman thought\
  \ i was the little kid in one of the movies (can\u2019t remember the name now) and\
  \ he wanted to take my picture and interview me. i totally played along with it.\
  \ he brought me over to introduce me to the rest of the staff. we chatted about\
  \ logistics and what kind of interview, etc and i nearly signed the release form\
  \ before i was found out! after the staff figured out my game, i was walking away\
  \ \u2013 but some other guests still thought i was the actor. so i got my picture\
  \ taken with a couple of them. thx indira for the picture! (september 15 nytf party)\
  \ ps. this was just after ignitenyc2 \u2013 if you guys were there, you remember\
  \ that half the room was nytvf people and we were roped off from them. after ignite\
  \ ended, we snuck onto their side to get at more free food/drinks \u2013 and then\
  \ this happened</p>"
