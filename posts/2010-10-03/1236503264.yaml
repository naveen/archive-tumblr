  >early-onset-of-night</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Say hello to mechanically separated\
  \ chicken. It\u2019s what all fast-food chicken is made from\u2014things like chicken\
  \ nuggets and patties. Also, the processed frozen chicken in the stores is made\
  \ from it.</p>\n<p>Basically, the entire chicken is smashed and pressed through\
  \ a sieve\u2014bones, eyes, guts, and all. it comes out looking like this.</p>\n\
  <p>There\u2019s more: because it\u2019s crawling with bacteria, it will be washed\
  \ with ammonia, soaked in it, actually. Then, because it tastes gross, it will be\
  \ reflavored artificially. Then, because it is weirdly pink, it will be dyed with\
  \ artificial color.</p>\n<p>But, hey, at least it tastes good, right?</p>\n<p>High\
  \ five, America!</p>\n<p><em>*smack*</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*SHUDDER*</p>\n\
