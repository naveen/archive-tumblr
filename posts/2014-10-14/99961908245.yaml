caption: !!python/str "<p><strong>Buying art</strong><br/><br/> I was talking to @lately\
  \ from <a href=\"http://helloartcity.com/\">The Art City Project</a>, which aims\
  \ to turn the city\u2019s public spaces into canvases for artists.<br/><br/> We\
  \ found that among some of our friends, no one buys art for their walls anymore\
  \ like they used to. Art is a great many things; different things for different\
  \ people. Mostly, art is about showing what you like and investing in and supporting\
  \ the artists you like.<br/><br/> Perhaps a younger audience just doesn\u2019t care\
  \ about art on their walls because they live in a world of transience: simpler homes,\
  \ moving apartments every few years, living in Airbnbs and leading a life that is\
  \ about renting &amp; sharing your goods more than it is about ownership. It could\
  \ also be because it\u2019s never been top of mind for a young audience: that perhaps\
  \ as you get older, you tend to buy a home and set down roots and buy nicer furniture\
  \ and nice art for your walls too. There\u2019s more permanence in life than you\u2019\
  re afforded when you\u2019re young.<br/><br/>Younger people have just found another\
  \ to show what they like: by wearing it. Art on shirts and art on shoes and hats.\
  \ The most perfect example of this is <a href=\"http://www.supremenewyork.com/\"\
  >Supreme</a>. As in the art world, they\u2019ve captured the idea of openings and\
  \ limited runs and price points. And just as in the art world, there\u2019s <a href=\"\
  http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/flipping-supreme\">a collector\u2019\
  s market worth millions</a>.<br/><br/> What happens when you create a platform to\
  \ turn your clothing into a canvas for artists? Open it up to more artists; open\
  \ it up to more people. Make artwork (and thereby, its creators) accessible to more\
  \ people.<br/><br/> You get to show and wear the art you like. And you get to support\
  \ the artists you like.</p>"
