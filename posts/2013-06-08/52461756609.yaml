  \ came over to visit spacecentre on friday afternoon.\_<span>i love having special\
  \ guests over, especially when they bring toys: this time it was google glass. we\
  \ all took turns trying it out.</span></p>\n<p>we started talking about interesting\
  \ apps one could build off of it in this prototype phase. my idea to erin was to\
  \ build \u2018ohsnapchatroulette\u2019. it works like this:\_<span>you take a photo\
  \ \u2013 glass sends that photo to the cloud \u2013 then it shows you a photo that\
  \ someone else took using the app. i think it\u2019ll be a hit.</span></p>"
