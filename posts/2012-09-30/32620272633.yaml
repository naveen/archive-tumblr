  \ a city is growing (new money, new people) based on the number of construction\
  \ cranes on the horizon. beirut is no exception. no doubt lots of change has come\
  \ since the end of the civil war but big projects are still in the works: nearly\
  \ a third of the city looks like it\u2019s being redeveloped and there\u2019s always\
  \ something just around the corner. (another measure might be the number of fancy\
  \ cars on the streets: i counted more in downtown beirut than i remember seeing\
  \ in most neighborhoods in new york city!)</p>"
