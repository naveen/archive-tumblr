  <blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m not a big fan of listening to what your customers say.\
  \ I don\u2019t believe most know what they want, and those that do, usually have\
  \ a very short sighted view of your product.\_</p>\n<p>What I am interested in is\
  \ watching what customers DO with your product. More often than not, they\u2019\
  ll surprise you with use cases you\u2019d either not considered or not prioritized\
  \ very\_aggressively.</p>\n<p>Consider the images above. Each contains a use case\
  \ from the past week or so for three of our portfolio companies. I\u2019d not considered\
  \ any of these use cases before.</p>\n<p>In the top image is a picture of Hello\
  \ Kitty. Cute right? Now look closer. Its actually a form of street art created\
  \ by a Runkeeper user who traced the image via a carefully planned 28 mile route\
  \ through the streets of Tokyo. The thought of using Runkeeper route traces to create\
  \ art had never crossed my mind. Amazing. You can see more of his Runkeeper art\
  \ <a href=\"http://blog.runkeeper.com/community/the-art-of-running\">here</a>.</p>\n\
  <p>Next is a page from a book I just finished reading called Do More, Faster. In\
  \ it the author used a Bitly link to reference content from the printed page to\
  \ a specific webpage. We\u2019re all used to seeing Bitly links on Twitter, in email\
  \ or across the web but in print? What a simple and powerful use case of a customized\
  \ Bitly link. Again, didn\u2019t see that one coming.</p>\n<p>The final image is\
  \ a screen grab of the documentation for v2 of Foursquare\u2019s API. The cool thing\
  \ about this image? The Foursquare team didn\u2019t translate the documentation,\
  \ their users did. Rather than wait around for the company to get to it, the users\
  \ took the translation into their own hands. I can see other countries doing similar\
  \ translation in the future. A new and powerful way the company can work directly\
  \ with their users that I didn\u2019t see coming.</p>\n<p>Any army of passionate\
  \ users is a powerful thing. Featuring, celebrating\_harnessing\_their creativity\
  \ can be game changing. We don\u2019t need to look much further than Twitter to\
  \ see just that.</p>\n<p>Would Twitter have become the juggernaut it is today if\
  \ not for its users creating social gestures within the service? Twitter, the company,\
  \ didn\u2019t invent the @ reply, the use of hashtags or the retweet. Each of these\
  \ were surfaced by their users bending the service to their own needs. And, in doing\
  \ so, giving the company a view into what they, the users, wanted it to become.</p>\n\
  <p>So stop listening to your customers and start watching what they do. Actions\
  \ have always spoken louder than words. Who knows, the actions of your users may\
  \ very well be telling you something more powerful about what your business can\
  \ become than what their, or your, words ever will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>huge\
  \ fan of gps art (both running and cycling)</p>\n<p>i\u2019ve been wanting to carve\
  \ secret messages into manhattan on my runs :)</p>"
