caption: !!python/str "<b>breakfast at shopsin\u2019s: i was finally brave enough\
  \ to go eat at kenny\u2019s place:</b>\n<p>i\u2019d been wanting to go here ever\
  \ since i read calvin trillin\u2019s piece in the new yorker [1] a while ago (one\
  \ of the best stories ever written, by the way!)<br/><br/>\nbut\u2026and it\u2019\
  s going to sound strange\u2026i was always afraid. afraid i might do something stupid\
  \ and get kicked out; afraid i might ask the wrong question and get kicked out;\
  \ afraid i\u2019d get yelled at for taking pictures; afraid i\u2019d get yelled\
  \ at for not bringing cash; afraid i\u2019d get yelled at for saying \u201Ci\u2019\
  ll have what she\u2019s having.\u201D; etc, etc. and i was always afraid to go there\
  \ by myself (i went there with alicia this morning)<br/><br/>\nwe walked in and\
  \ looked for a place to sit. kenny points to a table that\u2019s taken and says\
  \ casually (first thing he says to us!): \u201Cwell, you can\u2019t sit there because\
  \ of those ****ing kids\u2026why don\u2019t you sit over there instead?\u201D. i\
  \ had to hold back my laugh \u2013 now this is what i came here for! :)<br/><br/>\n\
  the menu easily has over 600+ items on it. i ordered bbq pork, mac &amp; cheese,\
  \ scrambled eggs and toast (all a single menu item! singleton, are you listening?!)\
  \ for breakfast.<br/><br/>\ni crossed off a place that\u2019s long been on my foursquare\
  \ todo list. go: <a href=\"http://foursquare.com/venue/1165\" rel=\"nofollow\">foursquare.com/venue/1165</a><br/><br/>\n\
  and make sure to check out the documentary \u201Ci like killing flies\u201D made\
  \ back when they were in their west village location [2]<br/><br/>\n1. <a href=\"\
