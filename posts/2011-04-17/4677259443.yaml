  <p>stumbled into an old folder and found foursquare prototype screengrabs from way\
  \ before we launched: one of the earliest complete sets from october 2008! i was\
  \ a baby back then! (no grey hairs on my stubble)<br/><br/>\nthe last one moves\
  \ into november \u2015 you can tell dennis and i originally were thinking about\
  \ achievements/city-as-a-game (complete with controller icon which i loved!) before\
  \ naming them \u2018badges\u2019. we had semi-working badges then, but they weren\u2019\
  t much to look at because we didn\u2019t have mari (and obviously no marsbots!!!)<br/><br/>\n\
  i love love the old school venue detail page and the whole \u201Ctodo list in your\
  \ pocket\u201D goes back a long way\u2015i can\u2019t believe i still haven\u2019\
  t been to di fara\u2019s!<br/><br/>\nhappy 4sq day!</p>"
