  \ want to start eating healthier. This was actually one of my goals a while back:\
  \ no red meats, no carbs, limit sugars, drink lots of water.</span></p>\n<p><span>Or,\
  \ l</span><span>et\u2019s say you want to stop drinking so much - at most two per\
  \ evening. (Well, you\u2019ve got to start somewhere).</span></p>\n<p><span>If you\
  \ hit that thing head on, you\u2019re just likely to give up in a couple of days\
  \ time. You\u2019re likely to revert back to your normal behavior and slowly start\
  \ cheating on the rules.</span></p>\n<p><span>So you should set what I\u2019ve come\
  \ to call a \u201Ctangent\u201D.</span></p>\n<p><span>You should set the actual\
  \ goal to be:</span></p>\n<p><span>\u201CI have to wake up early at 6am to get to\
  \ the gym.\u201D</span></p>\n<p><span>Which means you have to be in bed by 11pm\
  \ to get at least your seven hours sleep. Which means you have to come home by 10pm.\
  \ Which means it\u2019s harder to get so many drinks in you between 8pm when you\
  \ leave work and 10pm when you have to be home.</span></p>\n<p><span>(Better yet,\
  \ an easier tangent here might be: I\u2019ve got to drive myself home at the end\
  \ of the evening. This will naturally will hit your original goal.)</span></p>\n\
  <p><span>I find myself using tangents to check the most difficult habits off my\
  \ list.</span></p>"
