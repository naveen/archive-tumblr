  >T-Shirt Says to \u201CEat Less\u201D</a></p>\n<p>So Urbane Outfitters pulled this\
  \ T-shirt from their stores due to cries from anorexia groups that it sends the\
  \ wrong message. So let\u2019s look at the numbers:</p>\n<p>Prevalence of Anorexia\
  \ = 1%</p>\n<p>Prevalence of Obesity = 35%</p>\n<p>Americans eat, on average,\_\
  <a href=\"http://www.diet-blog.com/06/do_americans_eat_3790_calories_per_day.php\"\
  >3,790 calories a day</a>. That\u2019s nearly double what we should eat.\_<a href=\"\
  http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3040366\">Know how many\
  \ calories you should eat.</a></p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s safe to assume that the\
  \ US could stand to \u201Ceat less.\u201D It\u2019s a message the vast majority\
  \ of us need to implement in our lives. Because remember, the kids today are expected\
  \ to live a shorter, lower quality life than their parents. And that\u2019s not\
  \ due to anorexia.</p>\n<p>So here\u2019s a solution. Put a little asterisk and\
  \ then put \u201CUnless you are anorexic\u201D in fine print!</p>\n<p>UPDATE: So\
  \ any time I mention anything on my blog about eating less/obesity, it tends to\
  \ irk many people. A few people have commented saying \u201CNo, the US doesn\u2019\
  t need to eat less, we need to eat healthier.\u201D So here\u2019s the deal. If\
  \ one person eats 5,000 calories of fast food a day vs. another person who eats\
  \ 5,000 calories of food from Whole Foods, both will be obese. It\u2019s simple\
  \ physics. First, ensure you are taking in just the right amount of calories per\
  \ day. Then, ensure those calories come from healthy, fresh, and whole foods.</p>\n\
  <p>We need to have a real dialogue about this issue of obesity. Our culture doesn\u2019\
  t want to talk about it for fear of offending 35% of the population. But the real\
  \ issue is, it\u2019s killing 35% of the population. Coddling, being sensitive,\
  \ or ignoring the issue won\u2019t help us progress and solve this epidemic. So\
  \ what does the conversation look like? We desperately need to have the conversation\
  \ that obesity is bad for you, bad for our economy, and bad for the environment.\_\
