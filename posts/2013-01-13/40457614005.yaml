caption: '<p>muir woods.</p>

  <p>our first ever hike in these woods, where we went seeking quiet. the awesome
  height and ages-old wisdom of the redwoods is something to be seen in person. there
  was one tree we came across which had been burned and destroyed (probably by lighting
  many years ago). newer, younger trees have grown up all around it since, rising
  from its roots, growing strong, protecting it over the years.</p>'
